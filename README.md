# The TravisFoundation English-Tigrinya Parallel Corpus

 - Tigrinya-English parallel corpus
 
 - properties:
   - UTF-8 encoded
   - line-by-line formatting, i.e. line `i` in `some_file_EN` corresponds to line `i` in `some_file_TI`
 
 - provenance information:
   - large part is scraped from the Jehova's Witnesses web-site (without permission) 
     -> don't know the process and hence no grip on accuracy/appropriateness of translations
     -> language is highly biased towards religious topics ('Jesus' being the 4th most common word); 
        more problematically, the language represents the views of JW, some of which very opinionated or even intolerant
   - rest is crowd-sourced by ourselves (with the tremendous efforts from Eritrean volunteers), by translating snippets of articles from the English Wikipedia
