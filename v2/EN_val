8 Naomi urged Ruth to accept Boaz ’ offer to keep gleaning in his fields and to stay near the young women of his own household so that she would escape harassment from the reapers . Ruth took that advice . She also “ kept on dwelling with her mother-in-law . ” ( Ruth 2 :22 , 23 ) In those words we see once more her hallmark quality—loyal love . Ruth ’ s example may move us to ask ourselves whether we honor the bonds of family , loyally supporting our loved ones and offering them help as needed . Jehovah never fails to notice such loyal love .

HOW pleasant it is to hear good news ! And the best news of all is the good news of God ’ s Kingdom . This good news assures us of an end to suffering , sickness , pain , sorrow , and death . It opens the way to everlasting life , reveals God ’ s purpose , and shows us how to come into a loving relationship with him . You would think that everyone would rejoice to hear this news that Jesus shared with mankind . Sadly , though , that is not the case .
When do you read ? Do you benefit by reading early in the morning ? Or are you more alert later in the day ? If you can set aside even 15 or 20 minutes each day to do some reading , you will be amazed at how much you can accomplish . The key is regularity .
26 Then Jehovah said to Moses : “ Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians , their war chariots , and their cavalrymen . ” 27 Moses at once stretched out his hand over the sea , and as morning approached , the sea returned to its normal condition . As the Egyptians fled from it , Jehovah shook the Egyptians off into the midst of the sea . 28 The returning waters covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen and all of Pharʹaoh ’ s army who had gone into the sea after them . Not so much as one among them was allowed to survive .

4 Since “ all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction , ” we can learn from the many examples of faith recorded in the Bible . ( Rom . 15 :4 ) When we read about such people as Abraham , Sarah , Isaac , Jacob , Moses , Rahab , Gideon , Barak , and many others , these accounts may move us to examine our own faith . ( Heb . 11 :32-35 ) In addition , when we read modern-day accounts of brothers and sisters with outstanding faith , this can move us to work hard to strengthen our faith .

Paul concluded this section of his letter by referring to the strongest evidence of God ’ s generosity . “ Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift , ” wrote Paul . ( 2 Cor . 9 :15 ) Jehovah ’ s gift evidently includes the sum total of all the goodness that God extends to his people through Jesus Christ . It is so lofty that words can not fully describe its value .

15 Matters reached such a point that Jehovah sent “ a man of God , ” an unnamed prophet , to Eli with a strong message of judgment . Jehovah told Eli : “ You keep honoring your sons more than me . ” God thus foretold that Eli ’ s wicked sons would die on the same day and that Eli ’ s family would suffer greatly , even losing its privileged position in the priestly class . Did this powerful warning bring about a change in that family ? The record reveals no such change of heart .—1 Sam . 2 :27–3 :1 .

4 After reminding his brothers of their marvelous hope , Paul wrote : “ Deaden , therefore , your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality , uncleanness , uncontrolled sexual passion , hurtful desire , and greediness . ” ( Col . 3 :5 ) Immoral desires can be very powerful and can deprive us of spiritual treasures . One brother who was swept away by immoral desires said after he returned to the congregation , “ I was drawn by a force so powerful that I did not turn back until it was too late . ”
4 Not only did Jehovah encourage individuals but he also gave words of encouragement to his people as a group . In prophetic terms that would prove to be of comfort to the Jews held captive in Babylon , Jehovah stated : “ Do not be afraid , for I am with you . Do not be anxious , for I am your God . I will fortify you , yes , I will help you , I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness . ” ( Isa . 41 :10 ) The early Christians had the same assurance , and so do God ’ s people today .—Read 2 Corinthians 1 :3 , 4 .

14 Are we to conclude from such examples that to be loyal to Jehovah , a person has to be perfect or that one who makes a mistake has completely failed ? By no means ! The Bible tells us that at times Moses fell short . Although Jehovah was displeased , he did not reject Moses . The apostles of Jesus Christ also had their weaknesses . Taking into account our inheritance of imperfection , Jehovah is pleased if we do not deliberately ignore his will in any respect . If because of weakness we do become involved in wrongdoing , it is important that we sincerely repent and not make a practice of the error . In this way we demonstrate that we truly do love what Jehovah says is good and hate what he shows to be bad . On the basis of our faith in the sin-atoning value of Jesus ’ sacrifice , we can enjoy a clean standing before God .—Amos 5 :15 ; Acts 3 :19 ; Hebrews 9 :14 .

10 “ You are to sow your land with seed and gather its produce for six years . 11 But the seventh year you should leave it uncultivated and let it lie fallow , and the poor among your people will eat of it , and what they leave , the wild animals of the field will eat . That is what you should do with your vineyard and your olive grove .

10 The demons trick people in many ways . When people contact the demons they do it either directly or through someone else , such as a witch doctor or a psychic . Contact with the demons is called demonism or spiritism . But the Bible commands us to stay far away from anything that has to do with the demons . ( Galatians 5 :19-21 ) Why ? Just as a hunter uses a trap to catch animals , the demons use tricks to trap and control people .—See Endnote 26 .

19 Then the second lot came out for Simʹe·on , for the tribe of Simʹe·on by their families . And their inheritance was within the inheritance of Judah . 2 Their inheritance was Beʹer-sheʹba with Sheʹba , Mo·laʹdah , 3 Haʹzar-shuʹal , Baʹlah , Eʹzem , 4 El·toʹlad , Beʹthul , Horʹmah , 5 Zikʹlag , Beth-marʹca·both , Haʹzar-suʹsah , 6 Beth-le·baʹoth , and Sha·ruʹhen—13 cities and their settlements ; 7 Aʹin , Rimʹmon , Eʹther , and Aʹshan—four cities and their settlements ; 8 and all the settlements that were around these cities as far as Baʹal·ath-beʹer , Raʹmah of the south . This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simʹe·on by their families . 9 The inheritance of the descendants of Simʹe·on was taken out of the allotment of Judah , because the share of Judah was too large for them . So the descendants of Simʹe·on received a possession within their inheritance .

17 First , we rejoice to see Jehovah ’ s role in the work . When we preach the Kingdom message , we sow seed . ( Matt . 13 :18 , 19 ) When we help someone to become a disciple of Christ , we harvest fruitage . And all of us feel deep joy as we observe with awe how Jehovah causes Kingdom seed to “ sprout and grow tall . ” ( Mark 4 :27 , 28 ) Some seed that we scatter sprouts later and is harvested by others . You may have had an experience similar to that of Joan , a Christian sister in Britain who was baptized 60 years ago . She said : “ I have met individuals who told me that I planted a seed in their heart when I preached to them years ago . Unknown to me , other Witnesses later studied the Bible with them and helped them to become servants of Jehovah . I rejoice that the seed I planted grew and was harvested . ” —Read 1 Corinthians 3 :6 , 7 .
Daily Bible reading requires self-discipline . You are not born with a desire for it . You need to “ form a longing ” for God ’ s Word . ( 1 Pet . 2 :2 ) As you cultivate the habit , your spiritual appetite will grow . Then you may find that you want to broaden out by undertaking special projects of Bible reading and study to deepen your understanding and appreciation for the spiritual riches that Jehovah has made available to us .

If you are not careful , though , when you try to read , your mind may wander . Your eyes may look at the page , but your thoughts may be elsewhere . Is music playing ? Is the television on ? Are family members talking ? If possible , it is best to read in a quiet location . However , the distraction may come from within . Perhaps you had a busy day . Alas , how easy it is to replay the day ’ s activities in your mind ! It is good , of course , to review the day ’ s events—but not when you are reading . Perhaps you start out with your mind focused , or you may even open your reading session with a prayer . But then as you read , your mind begins to drift . Try again . Discipline yourself to keep your mind focused on the material you are reading . Gradually , you will see improvement .

Go and tell your lord : ‘ E·liʹjah is here . ’ ” 9 But he said : “ What sin have I committed that you should hand your servant over to Aʹhab to put me to death ? 10 As surely as Jehovah your God is living , there is not a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent to look for you . After they said , ‘ He is not here , ’ he made the kingdom and the nation swear that they could not find you . 11 Now you are saying , ‘ Go and tell your lord : “ E·liʹjah is here . ” ’ 12 When I depart from you , the spirit of Jehovah will carry you away to a place I will not know , and when I tell Aʹhab and he does not find you , he will surely kill me . Yet , your servant has feared Jehovah from his youth . 13 Has my lord not been told what I did when Jezʹe·bel was killing the prophets of Jehovah , how I hid 100 of the prophets of Jehovah by groups of 50 in a cave and kept supplying them bread and water ? 14 But now you are saying , ‘ Go and tell your lord : “ E·liʹjah is here . ” ’ He will certainly kill me . ” 15 However , E·liʹjah said : “ As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve is living , today I will present myself to him . ”

As the term “ charitable planning ” implies , these types of donations typically require some planning on the part of the donor . To assist individuals desiring to benefit the worldwide work of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses through some form of charitable giving , a brochure entitled Charitable Planning to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide has been prepared . The brochure , available in English and Spanish , was written to provide information on a variety of ways that gifts may be made now or later , such as through a bequest at death . The information covered in this brochure may not apply fully to your situation because of tax laws or other laws in your country . By using such methods of charitable giving , many have helped to support our religious and humanitarian activities worldwide and maximize tax benefits . If available in your country , the brochure may be obtained by requesting a copy from the secretary of the local congregation .

3 Jehovah responded immediately . He pronounced sentence on the rebels in Eden , and at the same time , he provided a glimpse of something wondrous : his purpose to remedy the ills they had just set in motion . ( Genesis 3 :15 ) Jehovah ’ s farsighted purpose extends from Eden through all the thousands of years of human history and onward , far into the future . It is elegantly simple yet so profound that a Bible reader could spend a rewarding lifetime in studying and contemplating it . Furthermore , Jehovah ’ s purpose is absolutely sure of success . It will put an end to all wickedness , sin , and death . It will bring faithful mankind to perfection . All of this will come about before the seventh day ends , so that , despite everything , Jehovah will have fulfilled his purpose for the earth and mankind right on schedule !

7 Do we need to worry that Jesus might misuse his power ? Absolutely not ! Jesus really loves his Father and would never do anything to displease him . ( John 8 :29 ; 14 :31 ) Jesus well knows that Jehovah never misuses his almighty power . Jesus has observed firsthand that Jehovah searches for opportunities “ to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him . ” ( 2 Chronicles 16 :9 ) Indeed , Jesus shares his Father ’ s love for mankind , so we can trust that Jesus will always use his power for good . ( John 13 :1 ) Jesus has established a flawless record in this regard . Let us consider the power he had while on earth and how he was moved to use it .
4 Because of our sinful nature , pride and haughtiness arise easily in most of us , whereas humility is a rare quality that we need to work hard to cultivate and maintain . Even after years of faithful service to God , we may give in to stubbornness and pride . For example , consider Korah , who faithfully stuck with Jehovah ’ s people through many hardships . Still , he craved more authority and brazenly led a rebellion against Moses , the meekest man alive at that time . ( Numbers 12 :3 ; 16 :1-3 ) Think , too , of King Uzziah , whose pride led him to enter Jehovah ’ s temple and carry out a sacred duty reserved for the priests . ( 2 Chronicles 26 :16-21 ) Such men paid dearly for their rebellion . Yet , their negative examples are useful reminders for all of us . We need to combat the pride that makes it difficult for us to respect authority .

24 So Moses went out and spoke the words of Jehovah to the people . And he gathered 70 men from the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent . 25 Then Jehovah came down in a cloud and spoke to him and took away some of the spirit that was on him and put it on each of the 70 elders . And as soon as the spirit settled down on them , they began to behave as prophets , but they did not do it again .
Knowledge is of little value if not used . But it takes humility to apply what we learn . This article will encourage us to maintain humility by imitating Bible examples of those who preached to people of all sorts , prayed for others , and waited on Jehovah to act .

For example , I gave my first public talk as a circuit overseer in front of a village store out in the open . I soon learned that it was the custom in the Philippines in those days for a public talk to be really public ! As I visited different congregations in the circuit , I delivered talks in public gazebos , at markets , in front of municipal halls , on basketball courts , in parks , and often on city street corners . Once in San Pablo City , a downpour prevented me from giving a talk at a public market , so I suggested to the responsible brothers that it be given in the Kingdom Hall . Afterward , the brothers asked whether this could be reported as a public meeting , since it was not held in a public place !

24 Jesus told his apostles to go to Galilee , where they would meet him again . When they arrived , Peter decided to go out fishing on the Sea of Galilee . Several others accompanied him . Once again , Peter found himself on the lake where he had spent much of his earlier life .

The men caught no fish all that night .—Matt . 26 :32 ; John 21 :1-3 .
11 It was fitting for Christians in Rome to analyze what their focus in life really was . Could it be that their lives were dominated by or centered on “ things of the flesh ” ? And it is fitting for us to consider the same about our lives . What is of greatest interest to us , and to what does our speech gravitate ? What do we really pursue day in and day out ? Some may find that they are focusing on trying different types of wine , decorating the home , finding new clothing styles , making investments , planning vacation trips , and the like . Such matters are not bad in themselves ; they can be normal aspects of life . For example , Jesus once made wine , and Paul told Timothy to take “ a little wine . ” ( 1 Tim . 5 :23 ; John 2 :3-11 ) But did Jesus and Paul “ constantly talk about , engage and glory in ” wine ? Was it their passion , what they ‘ constantly talked ’ about ? No . What about us ? What is our key interest in life ?

Will Saul come down as your servant has heard ? O Jehovah the God of Israel , please tell your servant . ” To this Jehovah said : “ He will come down . ” 12 David asked : “ Will the leaders of Keiʹlah surrender me and my men into Saul ’ s hand ? ” Jehovah replied : “ They will surrender you . ”

25 After Rachel had given birth to Joseph , Jacob immediately said to Laʹban : “ Send me away so that I may go to my place and to my land . 26 Give over my wives and my children , for whom I have served with you , that I may go , for you well know how I have served you . ” 27 Then Laʹban said to him : “ If I have found favor in your eyes , —I have understood by the omens that Jehovah is blessing me because of you . ” 28 And he added : “ Stipulate your wages to me , and I will give them . ” 29 So Jacob said to him : “ You know how I have served you and how your herd has fared with me ; 30 you had little before my coming , but your herd has increased and multiplied , and Jehovah has blessed you since I arrived . So when will I do something for my own house ? ”

30 At length E·liʹjah said to all the people : “ Approach me . ” So all the people approached him . Then he repaired the altar of Jehovah that had been torn down . 31 E·liʹjah then took 12 stones , corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom Jehovah ’ s word had come , saying : “ Israel will be your name . ” 32 With the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah . Then he made a trench all around the altar , an area large enough to sow with two seah measures of seed . 33 After that he put the pieces of wood in order , cut the young bull into pieces , and placed it on the wood . He now said : “ Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the pieces of wood . ” 34 Then he said : “ Do it again . ” So they did it again . Once more he said : “ Do it a third time . ” So they did it a third time . 35 And the water ran all around the altar , and he also filled the trench with water .

32 “ ‘ As for the houses of the Levites within their cities , the Levites will have the permanent right to repurchase them . 33 When the property of the Levites is not bought back , the house sold in the city belonging to them will also be released in the Jubilee , because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their property among the Israelites . 34 Moreover , the field of pasture ground surrounding their cities may not be sold , for it is their permanent possession .

When children see that their parents are honest , it becomes easier for them to be honest .
14 To highlight such spiritual protection , recall the parents mentioned at the outset of the preceding article . A few days after their daughter , Theresa , was reported missing , they received devastating news : She had been murdered . The father recalls : “ I had prayed for Jehovah to protect her . When she was found murdered , I must admit that I initially wondered why my prayers were not answered . Of course , I know that Jehovah does not guarantee miraculous protection for his people individually . I continued to pray for understanding . I have been comforted in the knowledge that Jehovah protects his people spiritually—that is , he provides what we need in order to safeguard our relationship with him . That type of protection is most important , for it can affect our eternal future . In that sense , Jehovah did protect Theresa ; she was serving him faithfully at the time of her death . I have found peace in knowing that her future life prospects are in his loving hands . ”

5 Many today think that to be truly free , they must be able to do anything and everything they want to do , regardless of the consequences . The World Book Encyclopedia defines freedom as “ the ability to make choices and to carry them out . ” However , it adds : “ From a legal point of view , people are free if society imposes no unjust , unnecessary , or unreasonable limits on them . ” This implies that , in practice , certain limits are necessary so that everyone in that society can benefit from the freedom granted . The question , then , is : Who has the right to determine what limits are just , necessary , and reasonable ?

12 In the 11th century B .C .E . , Jehovah shed further light on the sacred secret when he made another covenant . He promised faithful King David : “ I shall certainly raise up your seed after you , . . . and I shall indeed firmly establish his kingdom . . . . I shall certainly establish the throne of his kingdom firmly to time indefinite . ” ( 2 Samuel 7 :12 , 13 ; Psalm 89 :3 ) Now the lineage of the promised Seed had been narrowed down to the house of David . But could an ordinary human rule “ to time indefinite ” ? ( Psalm 89 :20 , 29 , 34-36 ) And could such a human king rescue mankind from sin and death ?

3 The Israelites assembled regularly to worship Jehovah and to listen to the reading of his Law . Certain days of their festivals were called holy conventions or solemn assemblies , indicating the sacred nature of these gatherings . ( Leviticus 23 :2 , 3 , 36 , 37 ) At a public assembly in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah , the Levites “ were explaining the law to the people . ” Since “ all the people were weeping as they were hearing the words of the law , ” the Levites “ were ordering all the people to be silent , saying : ‘ Keep quiet ! for this day is holy . ’ ” The Israelites then celebrated the seven-day Festival of Booths with “ very great rejoicing . ” Furthermore , “ there was a reading aloud of the book of the law of the true God day by day , from the first day until the last day ; and they went on holding the festival seven days , and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly , according to the rule . ” ( Nehemiah 8 :7-11 , 17 , 18 ) These were truly holy occasions requiring respectful attention on the part of those in attendance .

Not at all ! “ Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him . . .

22 Jehovah ’ s goodness is also associated with other qualities . For example , God is “ abundant in loving-kindness , ” or loyal love . ( Exodus 34 :6 ) This quality is more specific in its focus than is goodness , for Jehovah expresses it particularly toward his faithful servants . In the next chapter , we will learn how he does so .

8 Regrettably , Adam was not content with his God-given assignment as cultivator and caretaker of the earthly paradise . He was not satisfied with his extensive freedom to carry out his God-given mandate : “ Be fruitful and become many , fill the earth and subdue it , and have in subjection the fish . . . , the flying creatures . . . , and every living creature that is moving on the earth . ” ( Gen . 1 :28 ) Instead , he chose to overstep his God-ordained boundaries by eating the forbidden fruit . This gross misuse of free will resulted in millenniums of suffering and pain for Adam ’ s descendants . ( Rom . 5 :12 ) Knowing the consequences of Adam ’ s decision should move us to use our freedom responsibly and within the limits set by Jehovah .

ELIJAH had seen amazing things before . He had seen ravens carrying food to him twice a day while he lived in hiding . He had seen two containers supplying flour and oil throughout a long famine and never emptying . He had even seen fire falling from the sky in response to his prayer . ( 1 Kings , chapters 17 , 18 ) Still , Elijah had never seen anything like this .
23 “ ‘ When you finish purifying it from sin , you will offer a sound young bull of the herd and a sound ram from the flock . 24 You are to present them to Jehovah , and the priests must throw salt on them and offer them up as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah . 25 For seven days you will offer a male goat as a daily sin offering , as well as a young bull of the herd and a ram of the flock ; you will offer unblemished animals . 26 For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar , and they must cleanse it and install it . 27 When the days are completed , on the eighth day and thereafter , the priests will offer your whole burnt offerings and communion sacrifices on the altar ; and I will find pleasure in you , ’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah . ”
13 Even experienced servants of God need encouragement . Consider Joshua . He had served God faithfully for many years . Yet , Jehovah told Moses to encourage him , saying : “ Commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him , because he is the one who will cross over before this people and he is the one who will cause them to inherit the land that you will see . ” ( Deut . 3 :27 , 28 ) Joshua was about to take on the huge responsibility of leading the Israelites in the conquest of the Promised Land . He would face setbacks and at least one military defeat . ( Josh . 7 :1-9 ) No wonder Joshua needed to be encouraged and strengthened ! So let us personally encourage elders , including circuit overseers , who work hard to care for the flock of God . ( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 :12 , 13 . ) “ Sometimes the brothers give us a thank-you letter saying how much they enjoyed our visit , ” stated one circuit overseer . “ We keep these letters and read them when we are feeling low . They are a real source of encouragement . ”

Also Ziʹba , the attendant of the house of Saul , with his 15 sons and 20 servants , rushed down to the Jordan ahead of the king . 18 He crossed the ford to bring the king ’ s household across and to do whatever he desired . But Shimʹe·i the son of Geʹra fell down before the king when he was about to cross the Jordan . 19 He said to the king : “ Do not let my lord hold me guilty , and do not remember the wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem . May the king not take it to heart , 20 for your servant well knows that I have sinned ; so today I have been the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king . ”

9 As a result of careful , closer scrutiny of the subject , the Bible Students came to realize that the origin of Christmas and the practices associated with it actually dishonor God . The article “ The Origin of Christmas , ” in The Golden Age of December 14 , 1927 , noted that Christmas is a pagan celebration , focuses on pleasures , and involves idol worship . The article made it clear that the celebration was not ordered by Christ and concluded with this pointed statement about Christmas : “ The fact that the world , the flesh , and the Devil are in favor of its perpetuation and observance . . . is a final and conclusive argument against its celebration by those who are dedicated wholly to the service of Jehovah . ” Not surprisingly , the Bethel family did not celebrate Christmas that December—or ever again !

Because we love Jehovah above all else , we want to make his heart rejoice . ( Read Proverbs 27 :11 ; Mark 12 :29 , 30 . ) We know that his sovereignty , his right to rule the universe , has been challenged on earth ever since the rebellion in Eden and that the majority of mankind have sided with Satan and rejected Jehovah ’ s rule . We are thrilled to take the opposite stand . When we read the majestic words of Revelation 4 :11 , they strike a chord in our heart . How clear it is to us that Jehovah is the rightful Ruler of the universe ! We embrace Jehovah ’ s sovereignty , accepting his rule in our day-to-day life .

Jehovah ’ s servants highly esteem God ’ s own holy book , the Bible . Being imperfect , we all receive Scriptural counsel at times . How will we respond to it ? Consider the first-century Christians Euodia and Syntyche . Serious problems arose between these anointed women . The problems that existed between Euodia and Syntyche could have disrupted the peace of the whole congregation . The Bible does not tell us the outcome , but these sisters may have responded well to the apostle Paul ’ s loving counsel . ( Phil . 4 :2 , 3 ) Similar situations sometimes cause difficulties in congregations of Jehovah ’ s people today . However , such problems can be solved or even avoided if we apply the counsel found in God ’ s Word , the Bible . And if we highly esteem Jehovah ’ s own Book , we will live by its instructions .—Ps . 27 :11 . w16 .11 3 :1-3

24 Finally Jacob was left by himself . Then a man began to wrestle with him until the dawn broke . 25 When he saw that he had not prevailed over him , he touched the socket of his hip ; and the socket of Jacob ’ s hip was dislocated during his wrestling with him . 26 After that he said : “ Let me go , for the dawn is breaking . ” To this he said : “ I am not going to let you go until you bless me . ” 27 So he said to him : “ What is your name ? ” to which he said : “ Jacob . ” 28 Then he said : “ Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel , for you have contended with God and with men and you have at last prevailed . ” 29 In turn Jacob inquired : “ Tell me , please , your name . ” However , he said : “ Why is it that you ask my name ? ” With that he blessed him there . 30 So Jacob named the place Pe·niʹel , for he said , “ I have seen God face-to-face , yet my life was preserved . ”
8 God ’ s promise of protection is conditional—it is realized only by those who draw close to him . Proverbs 18 :10 states : “ The name of Jehovah is a strong tower . Into it the righteous runs and is given protection . ” In Bible times , towers were sometimes built in the wilderness as safe places of refuge . But it was up to the one in danger to flee to such a tower to find safety . It is similar with finding refuge in God ’ s name . This involves more than just repeating God ’ s name ; the divine name itself is no magic charm . Rather , we need to know and trust the Bearer of that name and live in harmony with his righteous standards . How kind of Jehovah to reassure us that if we turn to him in faith , he will be a tower of protection for us !

Before such a thing happens , you need to be prepared to give a good answer . Peter was not prepared . When pressure came , he lied ! Yet , he was very sorry about what he had done , and God forgave him .

26 This is the Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said : “ Bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt , company by company . ” 27 It was they who spoke to Pharʹaoh , Egypt ’ s king , to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt . It was this Moses and Aaron .

11 The Devil was clearly angry about the stand the brothers were taking with regard to the war , as imperfect as that stand was . As a result , he framed “ trouble in the name of the law . ” ( Ps . 94 :20 ) Major-General James Franklin Bell of the U .S . Army revealed in a conversation with Brothers J . F . Rutherford and W . E . Van Amburgh that the U .S . Department of Justice had tried to introduce a bill in Congress that would allow the death sentence to be imposed on individuals who refused to take up arms in the war . He meant the Bible Students in particular . In the heat of anger , General Bell said to Brother Rutherford : “ That bill did not pass because [ U .S . President ] Wilson prevented it ; but we know how to get you , and we are going to do it ! ”
3 Jehovah alone has absolute freedom , but the way he uses it sets a pattern for us . For example , he chose to select the nation of Israel as his name people , “ his special property . ” ( Deut . 7 :6-8 ) This was not an arbitrary choice . Jehovah was being true to a promise that he had made centuries earlier to his friend Abraham . ( Gen . 22 :15-18 ) Furthermore , Jehovah always exercises his freedom in harmony with his attributes of love and justice . This is evident in the way he disciplined the Israelites , who repeatedly abandoned true worship . When they expressed heartfelt repentance , Jehovah willingly extended love and mercy , saying : “ I will heal their unfaithfulness . I will love them of my own free will . ” ( Hos . 14 :4 ) What a fine example of using his freedom for the benefit of others !

11 We are also made stronger by divine education at our Christian meetings , assemblies , conventions , and in our theocratic schools .

Still , there might have been times when you were surprised to see a totally unexpected facet of your father ’ s personality . For instance , a son may know his father as a quiet and mild person—until an emergency occurs . Suddenly , he sees his father as determined and firm in protecting his family .
5 The second restriction can be deduced from a basic truth spoken by one of God ’ s faithful men of old . The prophet Azariah said to King Asa : “ Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him . ” ( 2 Chronicles 15 :2 ; read 1 Corinthians 10 :13 . ) Numerous recorded examples demonstrate that in the past , Satan always failed to devour any of God ’ s servants who remained close to God . ( Hebrews 11 :4-40 ) Today , a Christian who stays close to God will be able to oppose and even conquer the Devil . In fact , God ’ s Word assures us : “ Oppose the Devil , and he will flee from you . ” —James 4 :7 .

20 If a soldier forgets a piece of his armor and leaves a part of his body unprotected , that is where his enemy will attack him . If we want our “ armor ” to protect us , we can not forget a single piece . We need to wear it all the time and keep it in good condition . Our fight will continue until Satan ’ s world is destroyed and Satan and his demons are removed from the earth . ( Revelation 12 :17 ; 20 :1-3 ) So if we are fighting wrong desires or struggling with some weakness , we should not give up ! —1 Corinthians 9 :27 .

IMAGINE how thrilling it must have been to hear Jesus teach ! The Bible gives us glimpses of the impact he made on those who met him . For instance , Gospel writer Luke relates that people in Jesus ’ hometown “ began . . . to marvel at the winsome words proceeding out of his mouth . ” Matthew reports that those who listened to Jesus as he taught in the Sermon on the Mount “ were astounded at his way of teaching . ” And John observes that the officers who were sent to arrest Jesus returned empty-handed , saying : “ Never has another man spoken like this . ” —Luke 4 :22 ; Matt . 7 :28 ; John 7 :46 .

9 “ Safeguard your tongue against what is bad , and your lips against speaking deception . ” ( Psalm 34 :13 ) The apostle Peter was inspired to quote this part of Psalm 34 after he counseled Christians to treat one another with brotherly affection . ( 1 Peter 3 :8-12 ) Safeguarding our tongue from what is bad means that we will avoid spreading harmful gossip . Instead , we will always strive to be upbuilding when we talk to others . Further , we will strive to be courageous and speak the truth .—Ephesians 4 :25 , 29 , 31 ; James 5 :16 .
8 Today , Jehovah directs us in different ways . For example , he has given us the Bible . He has also given us the congregation elders . We show that we respect Jehovah ’ s authority when we respect those he uses to direct us . If we reject their help , in a sense we are rejecting Jehovah . When the Israelites rejected Moses , Jehovah viewed it seriously . He viewed it as if they were rejecting him .—Numbers 14 :26 , 27 ; see Endnote 12 .

27 Then Hez·e·kiʹah ordered that the burnt sacrifice be offered on the altar . When the burnt offering started , the song of Jehovah started and also the trumpets , following the direction of the instruments of King David of Israel . 28 And the whole congregation bowed down while the song was sung and the trumpets were sounding—all this continued until the burnt offering was finished . 29 And as soon as they finished making the offering , the king and all those with him bowed low and prostrated themselves . 30 King Hez·e·kiʹah and the princes now told the Levites to praise Jehovah with the words of David and of Aʹsaph the visionary . So they offered praise with great rejoicing , and they bowed down and prostrated themselves .
After recovering from his illness , Antonio was able to return to the traveling work . He had regularly shown interest in his fellow believers , but then he and his wife made a special effort to visit and encourage sick ones . For example , after visiting one Christian who was battling a serious illness , Antonio learned that this brother did not want to go to the meetings . “ It was not that he did not love Jehovah or the brothers , ” explains Antonio , “ but the illness had affected his emotions to such an extent that he felt useless . ”

20 If we want to be Jehovah ’ s friend , we must stop doing what Jehovah says is wrong , but we must also do more . ( Romans 12 :9 ) God ’ s friends love what he loves . They are described at Psalm 15 :1-5 . ( Read . ) Jehovah ’ s friends imitate his qualities and show “ love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faith , mildness , self-control . ” —Galatians 5 :22 , 23 .
19 Jehovah never asks us to do anything that we can not do . ( Deuteronomy 30 :11-14 ) As a real Friend , he knows us better than we know ourselves . He knows our strengths and our weaknesses . ( Psalm 103 :14 ) The apostle Paul encourages us : “ God is faithful , and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear , but along with the temptation he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it . ” ( 1 Corinthians 10 :13 ) We can be confident that Jehovah will always give us the strength to do what is right . He will give you “ the power beyond what is normal ” to help you to endure difficult situations . ( 2 Corinthians 4 :7 ) After experiencing Jehovah ’ s help during such times , Paul could say : “ For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power . ” —Philippians 4 :13 .

31 So his servants said to him : “ Look , we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings . Please , let us wear sackcloth on our hips and put ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel . Perhaps he will spare your life . ” 32 So they wore sackcloth around their hips and ropes on their heads and came in to the king of Israel and said : “ Your servant Ben-haʹdad says , ‘ Please , let me live . ’ ” He replied : “ Is he still alive ? He is my brother . ” 33 The men took it as an omen and quickly took him at his word , so they said : “ Ben-haʹdad is your brother . ” At that he said : “ Go and get him . ” Then Ben-haʹdad went out to him , and he had him get up into the chariot .

16 While walking alongside the Sea of Galʹi·lee , he saw Simon and Simon ’ s brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea , for they were fishermen . 17 So Jesus said to them : “ Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men . ” 18 And at once they abandoned their nets and followed him . 19 After going a little farther , he saw James the son of Zebʹe·dee and his brother John , while they were in their boat mending their nets , 20 and without delay he called them . So they left their father Zebʹe·dee in the boat with the hired men and went off after him . 21 And they went into Ca·perʹna·um .
A traveler is often encouraged when he sees a signpost that reassures him that he is on the right road . If an examination of your course in life reveals that you are walking the path of the righteous , be encouraged to continue . The most rewarding part of the journey lies just ahead .—2 Peter 3 :13 .
4 Ambassadors represent their government in a foreign land , so they do not get involved in the politics of that land . The anointed , who have the hope of ruling with Christ in heaven , are in a similar situation . Paul wrote to anointed Christians : “ We are ambassadors substituting for Christ . ” ( 2 Corinthians 5 :20 ) The anointed represent God ’ s government . They do not get involved in the political and governmental issues of this world . ( Philippians 3 :20 ) Instead , the anointed have helped millions of people to learn about God ’ s government . The “ other sheep , ” who have the hope of living forever in God ’ s new world , support the anointed . They too remain neutral . ( John 10 :16 ; Matthew 25 :31-40 ) Clearly , no true Christian would get involved in the politics of this world .—Read Isaiah 2 :2-4 .

4 Why is it important that we show love to fellow believers ? Put simply , love is the essence of true Christianity . Without love we can not have a close bond with fellow Christians , and more important , we amount to nothing in Jehovah ’ s sight . Consider how God ’ s Word highlights these truths .
3 Where did Jesus get this wisdom ? “ What I teach is not mine , ” he said , “ but belongs to him that sent me . ” ( John 7 :16 ) The apostle Paul explained that Jesus “ has become to us wisdom from God . ” ( 1 Corinthians 1 :30 ) Jehovah ’ s own wisdom is revealed through his Son , Jesus . Indeed , this was true to such an extent that Jesus could say : “ I and the Father are one . ” ( John 10 :30 ) Let us examine three areas in which Jesus manifested the “ wisdom from God . ”
2 What about you personally ? Are you happy ? Can you increase your happiness ? Happiness may be defined as “ a state of well-being that is characterized by relative permanence , by emotion ranging from mere contentment to deep and intense joy in living , and by a natural desire for it to continue . ” The Bible shows that true happiness refers to the condition of one who is blessed by Jehovah . In today ’ s world , though , being happy may be a challenge . Why ?

11 Pure conduct . To be viewed as pure by Jehovah , we must avoid sexual immorality of any kind . ( Read Ephesians 5 :5 . ) In the Bible , Jehovah tells us to “ flee from sexual immorality . ” He makes it clear that those who are immoral and do not repent “ will not inherit God ’ s Kingdom . ” —1 Corinthians 6 :9 , 10 , 18 ; see Endnote 22 .
6 War . Jesus said : “ Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom . ” ( Matthew 24 :7 ) More people have been killed in wars in our time than at any other time in history . One report from the Worldwatch Institute shows that since 1914 , wars have killed more than 100 million people . More than three times as many people were killed in wars during the 100 years between 1900 and 2000 as were killed during the previous 1 ,900 years . Just imagine the misery and pain that millions of people have felt because of war !
6 Back then , a laborer toiled 12 hours a day , 6 days a week , usually for just one denarius for the whole day . ( Matthew 20 :2-10 ) How does that compare with your wages or those of your friends ? It can be challenging to compare ancient wages with those of modern times . One way is to consider purchasing power , what money can buy . One scholar says that in Jesus ’ day a loaf of bread made with four cups of wheat flour cost about one hour ’ s pay . Another scholar says that a cup of good wine cost about two hour ’ s pay . You can see from such details that people at that time toiled long and hard to keep living . They needed relief and refreshment , as we do . If you are employed , you may feel pressured to produce more . Often we do not find time to make well-thought-out decisions . You may admit that you long for relief .
But the worst part was , not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
So that you can not say , ‘ Look ! I already know them . ’

15 Some years after those in Ephesus destroyed their books about magic , the apostle Paul wrote that they still had to “ struggle ” and fight “ against the wicked spirit forces . ” ( Ephesians 6 :12 ) Yes , even though they had already burned their books , the demons were still trying to harm them . So , what else did they need to do ? Paul told them : “ Take up the large shield of faith , with which you will be able to extinguish [ or , stop ] all the wicked one ’ s burning arrows . ” ( Ephesians 6 :16 ) Just as a shield protects a soldier in battle , our faith can protect us . If we have absolute confidence that Jehovah can protect us , we will be able to resist Satan and the demons .—Matthew 17 :20 .

Afterward they carried off a very great deal of spoil . 14 Further , they struck all the cities around Geʹrar , for the dread of Jehovah had come upon them ; and they plundered all the cities , for there was much to plunder in them . 15 They also attacked the tents of those with livestock , and they captured a great number of flocks and camels , after which they returned to Jerusalem .

23 Many people view the days of certain popular celebrations primarily as opportunities for family and friends to get together . Thus , if someone wrongly assumes that our Scriptural stand is unloving or extreme , we can kindly explain that Jehovah ’ s Witnesses value wholesome gatherings of family and friends . ( Proverbs 11 :25 ; Ecclesiastes 3 :12 , 13 ; 2 Corinthians 9 :7 ) We enjoy fellowship with loved ones throughout the year , but because of our love for God and for his righteous standards , we do not want to tarnish such happy occasions with customs that offend him .—See the box “ True Worship Brings the Greatest Joy . ”

The world promotes Satan ’ s way of thinking . This way of thinking is common among people who do not love and imitate Jehovah and who ignore his standards . ( 1 John 5 :19 ) Such thinking and the actions that it leads to is described as the spirit of the world . ( Ephesians 2 :2 ) Jehovah ’ s people make sure that they are not overcome by this spirit . ( Ephesians 6 :10-18 ) Instead , we love Jehovah ’ s ways and work hard to hold on to his way of thinking .
12 Then the men said to Lot : “ Do you have anyone else here ? Sons-in-law , your sons , your daughters , and all your people in the city , bring out of this place ! 13 For we are going to destroy this place , because the outcry against them has indeed grown great before Jehovah , so that Jehovah sent us to destroy the city . ” 14 So Lot went out and began to speak to his sons-in-law who were to marry his daughters , and he kept saying : “ Get up ! Get out of this place , because Jehovah will destroy the city ! ” But to his sons-in-law , he seemed to be joking .

Moreover , many who were paralyzed and lame were cured . 8 So there came to be a great deal of joy in that city .

8 What are some good works that Jehovah values ? Certainly our efforts to imitate his Son , Jesus Christ . ( 1 Peter 2 :21 ) One vital work that God values is the spreading of the good news of his Kingdom . At Romans 10 :15 , we read : “ How comely are the feet of those who declare good news of good things ! ” We may not normally think of our lowly feet as being “ comely , ” or beautiful . But here they represent the efforts Jehovah ’ s servants make in preaching the good news . All such efforts are beautiful and precious in his eyes .—Matthew 24 :14 ; 28 :19 , 20 .

9 Our Exemplar , Jesus , demonstrated his boldness in various ways . For instance , though hated by those having power and influence , Jesus did not water down what God wanted people to know . He fearlessly exposed the powerful religious leaders for their self-righteousness as well as for their false teachings . Those men stood condemned , and Jesus told them so in words both direct and unmistakable . On one occasion , he said : “ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because you resemble whitewashed graves , which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men ’ s bones and of every sort of uncleanness . In that way you also , outwardly indeed , appear righteous to men , but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness . ” —Matt . 23 :27 , 28 .

Then he headed toward the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad . 22 On the third day , Laʹban was told that Jacob had run away . 23 So he took his brothers with him and pursued him for a journey of seven days and caught up with him in the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad . 24 Then God came to Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan in a dream by night and said to him : “ Be careful about what you say to Jacob , either good or bad . ”

Jehovah gives us a worldwide brotherhood of caring worshippers who can offer us encouragement . ( Heb . 12 :12 , 13 ) Many in the first century received that sort of spiritual strengthening . It is similar today . What can we do ? Think of how Aaron and Hur literally supported Moses ’ hands during a battle . ( Ex . 17 :8-13 ) We can look for ways to support and to give practical aid to others . To whom ? To those battling the effects of old age , health limitations , opposition from their family , loneliness , or the loss of a loved one . We can also strengthen young ones who are facing pressure to share in wrongdoing or to seek “ success ” in this system of things , whether academically , financially , or professionally . ( 1 Thess . 3 :1-3 ; 5 :11 , 14 ) Look for ways to show genuine interest in others at the Kingdom Hall , in the ministry , while enjoying a meal together , or as you converse on the telephone . w16 .09 1 :13 , 14

16 Hope is essential to our present happiness . It can give us the joy we need to get through difficult times . Hope can protect our thinking too . Remember , the Bible likens hope to a helmet . ( 1 Thess . 5 :8 ) As a helmet protects a soldier ’ s head in battle , hope protects our mind from the negative , pessimistic thinking Satan promotes in this dying old world . Life is poor , indeed , when we are bereft of hope . We need to examine ourselves honestly , carefully considering the state of our own integrity and the hope linked to it . Do not forget that by keeping integrity , you are upholding Jehovah ’ s sovereignty and safeguarding your precious hope for the future . May you always hold fast to your integrity !

11 Jesus ’ confidence in Jehovah and his people was well-founded and still is . Indeed , when we consider the things that Jehovah is accomplishing through his servants in these last days , it is simply amazing . No other people are preaching the truth globally , for others do not have Jehovah guiding them as does his united congregation today . Isaiah 65 :14 describes the spiritual condition prevailing among God ’ s people : “ Look ! My servants will shout joyfully because of the good condition of the heart . ”

20 Although Joseph was far from his family and home , he was always loyal to God , and Jehovah blessed him . ( Genesis 41 :39-49 ) Jehovah was delighted with Joseph ’ s loyalty . ( Proverbs 27 :11 ) It can be difficult to resist immorality . But remember these words : “ O you who love Jehovah , hate what is bad . He is guarding the lives of his loyal ones ; he rescues them from the hand of the wicked . ” —Psalm 97 :10 .
2 But John , having heard in jail about the works of the Christ , sent his disciples 3 to ask him : “ Are you the Coming One , or are we to expect a different one ? ” 4 In reply Jesus said to them : “ Go and report to John what you are hearing and seeing : 5 The blind are now seeing and the lame are walking , the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing , the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news . 6 Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me . ”

She will lie in your arms so that my lord the king may feel warm . ” 3 They searched throughout all the territory of Israel for a beautiful girl , and they found Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite and brought her in to the king . 4 The girl was extremely beautiful , and she became the king ’ s nurse and waited on him , but the king did not have sexual relations with her .

18 This powerful man , Jesus , was nothing like those rulers who have wielded power in callous disregard for the needs and suffering of others . Jesus cared about people . The mere sight of the afflicted touched him so deeply that he was motivated to relieve their suffering . ( Matthew 14 :14 ) He was considerate of their feelings and needs , and this tender concern influenced the way he used his power . A moving example is found at Mark 7 :31-37 .

Not surprisingly , the courageous single sisters we interviewed faced challenges . How did they handle them ?
Boaz was clearly concerned about Ruth and her precarious situation as a foreigner . For one thing , he invited her to stay with his group of young women so that she would not be harassed by the men who were working in the field . He even made sure that she would get enough food and water , just like the hired workers . In addition , Boaz did not speak down to the poor foreign woman but , instead , reassured her . ( Ruth 2 :8-10 , 13 , 14 ) Not only was Boaz moved by Ruth ’ s unselfish love for her mother-in-law , Naomi , but he was also impressed that she had become a worshipper of Jehovah . Boaz ’ kindness was actually an expression of Jehovah ’ s loyal love toward a woman who had come to ‘ seek refuge under the wings of the God of Israel . ’ ( Ruth 2 :12 , 20 ; Prov . 19 :17 ) Similarly today , our kindly demeanor can help “ all sorts of people ” recognize the truth and sense how much Jehovah loves them .—1 Tim . 2 :3 , 4 . w16 .10 1 :10-12
27 “ ‘ If any one of the people of the land sins unintentionally and becomes guilty by doing one of the things that Jehovah commands should not be done , 28 or if he becomes aware of a sin that he has committed , then he should bring a sound young female goat as his offering for the sin he has committed . 29 He will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the same place as the burnt offering . 30 The priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and he will pour all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar . 31 He will remove all its fat , just as the fat is removed from the communion sacrifice , and the priest will make it smoke on the altar as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah ; and the priest will make atonement for him , and it will be forgiven him .

22 So they brought him to the place called Golʹgo·tha , which means , when translated , “ Skull Place . ” 23 Here they tried to give him wine drugged with myrrh , but he would not take it . 24 And they nailed him to the stake and distributed his outer garments by casting lots over them to decide who would take what . 25 It was now the third hour , and they nailed him to the stake . 26 And the inscription of the charge against him was written : “ The King of the Jews . ” 27 Moreover , they put two robbers on stakes alongside him , one on his right and one on his left . 28 —— 29 And those passing by spoke abusively to him , shaking their heads and saying : “ Ha ! You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days , 30 save yourself by coming down off the torture stake . ” 31 In the same way also , the chief priests with the scribes were mocking him among themselves , saying : “ Others he saved ; himself he can not save ! 32 Let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down off the torture stake , so that we may see and believe . ” Even those who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him .

3 Why should the topic of compassion interest you ? Because the Bible urges you to imitate Jehovah . ( Eph . 5 :1 ) Yet , while humans were created to be compassionate , our imperfection as descendants of Adam inclines us toward self-interest . Sometimes we may find that it is not easy to decide whether we will help others or concentrate on ourselves . For some , this is an ongoing conflict , or a balancing act . What can help you to develop and maintain your interest in others ? First , take time to examine how Jehovah has shown compassion and how others have shown it . Second , consider how you can imitate God ’ s example and how your doing so is truly beneficial .
11 Also , every priest takes his station day after day to offer holy service and to make the same sacrifices often , which can never take sins away completely . 12 But this man offered one sacrifice for sins for all time and sat down at the right hand of God , 13 from then on waiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet . 14 For it is by one sacrificial offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect for all time . 15 Moreover , the holy spirit also bears witness to us , for after it has said : 16 “ ‘ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , ’ says Jehovah . ‘ I will put my laws in their hearts , and in their minds I will write them . ’ ” 17 Then it says : “ And I will no longer call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind . ” 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer an offering for sin .

15 When the sons of the prophets at Jerʹi·cho saw him from a distance , they said : “ The spirit of E·liʹjah has settled down on E·liʹsha . ” So they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him . 16 They said to him : “ Here are 50 capable men with your servants . Let them go , please , to look for your master . Perhaps the spirit of Jehovah has lifted him up and then thrown him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys . ” But he said : “ Do not send them . ” 17 However , they kept urging him until he was embarrassed , so he said : “ Send them . ” They sent the 50 men , who kept looking for three days but did not find him . 18 When they returned to him , he was staying in Jerʹi·cho . Then he said to them : “ Did I not tell you not to go ? ”
God ’ s Law to the Israelites showed Jehovah ’ s strong feelings against clothing that does not make clear the distinction between male and female—what has been described in our day as unisex fashion . ( Deut . 22 :5 ) From God ’ s stated direction about clothing , we clearly see that God is not pleased with styles of dress that feminize men , that make women look like men , or that make it hard to see the difference between men and women . God ’ s Word contains principles that help Christians make good decisions about how to dress . That is so no matter where they live , what their culture is , or what the climate is . We do not need detailed lists saying which styles of dress are acceptable and which are objectionable . Rather , we are guided by Scriptural principles that allow room for personal preferences . w16 .09 3 :3 , 4

In the days of the prophet Malachi , the Israelites claimed to have Jehovah as their Father .

That is why Jehovah asked them : “ If I am a father , where is the honor to me ? ” —Malachi 1 :6 .

I wish you were cold or else hot . 16 So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold , I am going to vomit you out of my mouth . 17 Because you say , “ I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all , ” but you do not know that you are miserable and pitiful and poor and blind and naked , 18 I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich , and white garments so that you may become dressed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be exposed , and eyesalve to rub in your eyes so that you may see .

20 Along with Jesus , these anointed ones become “ Abraham ’ s seed . ” ( Galatians 3 :29 ) The first ones chosen were fleshly Jews . But in 36 C .E . , another aspect of the sacred secret was revealed : Gentiles , or non-Jews , would also share in the heavenly hope . ( Romans 9 :6-8 ; 11 :25 , 26 ; Ephesians 3 :5 , 6 ) Would anointed Christians be the only ones to enjoy the blessings promised to Abraham ? No , for Jesus ’ sacrifice benefits the whole world . ( 1 John 2 :2 ) In time , Jehovah revealed that an unnumbered “ great crowd ” would survive the end of Satan ’ s system of things . ( Revelation 7 :9 , 14 ) Multitudes more would be resurrected with the prospect of living forever in Paradise ! —Luke 23 :43 ; John 5 :28 , 29 ; Revelation 20 :11-15 ; 21 :3 , 4 .

8 Evidently , Jesus performed no miracles when he was a boy growing up in Nazareth . But that changed after he was baptized in 29 C .E . , at about 30 years of age . ( Luke 3 :21-23 ) The Bible tells us : “ God anointed him with holy spirit and power , and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil . ” ( Acts 10 :38 ) “ Doing good ” —does that not indicate that Jesus used his power aright ? After his anointing , he “ became a prophet powerful in work and word . ” —Luke 24 :19 .

17 Imagine this situation . A father does not allow his daughter and a young Christian man to go out unchaperoned . The girl responds : “ But Dad , don ’ t you trust me ? We won ’ t do anything wrong ! ” She may love Jehovah and have the best of intentions , yet is she walking “ in [ godly ] wisdom ” ? Is she ‘ fleeing from sexual immorality ’ ? Or is she foolishly trusting “ in [ her ] own heart ” ? ( Proverbs 28 :26 ) Perhaps you can think of additional principles that would assist such a father and his daughter in reasoning on the matter .—See Proverbs 22 :3 ; Matthew 6 :13 ; 26 :41 .
13 Back in Eden , Jehovah made clear his purpose for the earth : It was to be inhabited by a happy , healthy , united family of mankind .

Rest assured , though , that Jehovah ’ s purposes are never thwarted .

Regarding the recommendations made in Studies in the Scriptures , it said : “ We wonder if such a course would not mean compromise . ” But what if a Christian were threatened with being shot for refusing a uniform and military service ? The article reasoned : “ Would it be any worse to be shot because of loyalty to the Prince of Peace and refusal to disobey His order than to be shot while under the banner of these earthly kings and apparently giving them support and , in appearance at least , compromising the teachings of our Heavenly King ?

6 At this Jehovah said to Joshua : “ Do not be afraid because of them , for about this time tomorrow , I am giving over all of them slain to Israel . Their horses you must hamstring , and their chariots you must burn in the fire . ” 7 Joshua together with all the fighting men then launched a surprise attack against them along the waters of Merʹom . 8 Jehovah gave them into Israel ’ s hand , and they defeated them and pursued them as far as Great Siʹdon and Misʹre·photh-maʹim and the Valley of Mizʹpeh to the east , and they struck them down until no survivors remained . 9 Joshua then did to them just as Jehovah had told him ; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots in the fire .

55 When the men of Israel saw that A·bimʹe·lech was dead , they all went back home . 56 Thus God repaid A·bimʹe·lech for the evil that he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers . 57 God also made all the evil of the men of Sheʹchem come back on their own heads . So the curse of Joʹtham the son of Jer·ub·baʹal came upon them .

3 Je·hoʹram the son of Aʹhab became king over Israel in Sa·marʹi·a in the 18th year of King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah , and he reigned for 12 years . 2 He kept doing what was bad in Jehovah ’ s eyes , but not to the extent of his father or his mother , for he removed the sacred pillar of Baʹal that his father had made . 3 However , he clung to the sins that Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat had caused Israel to commit . He did not depart from them .
7 “ It was not because you were the most numerous of all the peoples that Jehovah showed affection for you and chose you , for you were the smallest of all the peoples . 8 Rather , it was because of Jehovah ’ s love for you and because he kept the oath that he had sworn to your forefathers that Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand , to redeem you from the house of slavery , from the power of Pharʹaoh king of Egypt . 9 You well know that Jehovah your God is the true God , the faithful God , keeping his covenant and loyal love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments . 10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face with destruction . He will not be slow to deal with those who hate him ; he will repay them to their face . 11 Therefore , take care to keep the commandments and the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am commanding you today , by observing them .

17 Another way that we can grow in our love for God is to meditate on the abundant loving provisions he has made to let us enjoy life—the beauty of creation , the endless variety of delicious things to eat , the warm companionship of good friends , as well as countless other delights that give us pleasure and satisfaction . ( Acts 14 :17 ) The more we learn about our God , the more reasons we have to appreciate his boundless goodness and generosity . Think about all the things that Jehovah has done for you personally . Do you not agree that he deserves your love ?

During the time leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem , Ezekiel served as a watchman along with Jeremiah , just as Isaiah had previously done .

8 Then Jehovah said to Joshua : “ Do not be afraid or be terrified . Take with you all the fighting men and go up against Aʹi . See , I have handed over to you the king of Aʹi , his people , his city , and his land . 2 Do to Aʹi and to its king just as you did to Jerʹi·cho and its king , except you may plunder its spoil and its livestock for yourselves . Set an ambush behind the city . ”

18 To lie is to say something untruthful . However , Jehovah wants his people to go beyond not telling outright lies . He urged the ancient Israelites : “ You should be holy , because I , Jehovah your God , am holy . ” Then he gave examples of being holy . In part , God said : “ You must not steal , you must not deceive , and you must not deal falsely with one another . ” ( Lev . 19 :2 , 11 ) Sadly , a person who makes it a point never to tell outright lies might still resort to deceiving others , dealing falsely with them .
13 “ This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says : ‘ Because they are saying to you , “ You are a land that devours people and bereaves your nations of children , ” ’ 14 ‘ therefore , you will no longer devour people or make your nations childless , ’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah . 15 ‘ I will not subject you to any more insults of the nations or make you bear the taunts of people , and you will no longer cause your nations to stumble , ’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah . ”

5 Therefore , now that we have been declared righteous as a result of faith , let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ , 2 through whom we also have obtained access by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand ; and let us rejoice , based on hope of the glory of God . 3 Not only that , but let us rejoice while in tribulations , since we know that tribulation produces endurance ; 4 endurance , in turn , an approved condition ; the approved condition , in turn , hope , 5 and the hope does not lead to disappointment ; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit , which was given to us .
23 The Phi·lisʹtine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Daʹgon their god and to celebrate , for they were saying : “ Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand ! ” 24 When the people saw him , they praised their god and said : “ Our god has given into our hand our enemy , the one who devastated our land and killed so many of us . ”

Yes , in him 11 with whom we are in union and were assigned as heirs , having been foreordained according to the purpose of the one who accomplishes all things as he decides according to his will , 12 so that we who have been first to hope in the Christ should serve for the praise of his glory . 13 But you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth , the good news about your salvation . After you believed , you were sealed by means of him with the promised holy spirit , 14 which is a token in advance of our inheritance , for the purpose of releasing God ’ s own possession by a ransom , to his glorious praise .

16 Jesus was unselfish in the use of his power , never employing it for personal gain . When he was hungry , he refused to turn stones into bread for himself . ( Matthew 4 :1-4 ) His meager possessions were evidence that he did not profit materially from the use of his power . ( Matthew 8 :20 ) There is further proof that his powerful works sprang from unselfish motives . When he performed miracles , he did so at some cost to himself . When he cured the sick , power went out of him . He was sensitive to this outflow of power , even in the case of just one cure . ( Mark 5 :25-34 ) Yet , he let crowds of people touch him , and they were healed . ( Luke 6 :19 ) What a selfless spirit !

The apostle Paul wrote : “ I am afraid that somehow , as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning , your minds might be corrupted away from . . . the Christ . ” ( 2 Corinthians 11 :3 ) Working through a cautious serpent , Satan seduced Eve into following a disastrous course . He sought to corrupt her mind , to warp her thinking . The tactic worked . Because she listened , her viewpoint changed , and what was unlawful became desirable . Once her mind was corrupted , she was easily drawn into a sinful act .—Genesis 3 :1-6 ; Revelation 12 :9 .

1 . A husband must love his wife as his own body . Jesus set the example for husbands . He said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another . ” To what extent ? “ Just as I have loved you , ” he said . ( John 13 :34 ) Applying this principle to husbands , the Bible says : “ Husbands , continue loving your wives , just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it . . . In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself , for no man ever hated his own flesh ; but he feeds and cherishes it , as the Christ also does the congregation . ” —Ephesians 5 :25 , 28 , 29 .

( Genesis 17 :1 , 2 ; Hebrews 6 :13-15 ) How remarkable that the Sovereign Lord actually contracted to bless mankind !

6 Our worship should be based on the Bible . The Bible says : “ All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching , for reproving , for setting things straight , for disciplining in righteousness , so that the man of God may be fully competent , completely equipped for every good work . ” ( 2 Timothy 3 :16 , 17 ) The apostle Paul wrote to Christians : “ When you received God ’ s word , which you heard from us , you accepted it not as the word of men but , just as it truthfully is , as the word of God . ” ( 1 Thessalonians 2 :13 ) True worship is based only on God ’ s Word , the Bible . It is not based on human ideas , traditions , or anything else .

3 Creation proves that God is the incomparable Organizer . “ Jehovah founded the earth in wisdom , ” says the Bible . “ He solidly established the heavens in discernment . ” ( Prov . 3 :19 ) We know only “ the fringes of [ God ’ s ] ways , ” and “ only a faint whisper has been heard of him . ” ( Job 26 :14 ) Yet , the little we know about planets , stars , and galaxies moves us to acknowledge that these celestial bodies are superbly organized . ( Ps . 8 :3 , 4 ) Galaxies consist of millions of stars , all moving in space in an orderly way . Why , planets in our solar system travel in orbits around the sun as though they were humbly obeying traffic laws ! Surely the mind-boggling order evident in the universe helps us to see that Jehovah , who “ skillfully made the heavens ” and the earth , deserves our praise , loyalty , and worship .—Ps . 136 :1 , 5-9 .

May we learn that lesson as well . Do we daily ask God ’ s forgiveness for our many errors ? Do we then accept that forgiveness and believe in its power to cleanse us ? And do we extend forgiveness to those around us as well ? If we do , we will imitate the faith of Peter—and the mercy of his Master .
In God ’ s Word , blood is considered to be equivalent to life . Hence , instead of being condemned because he broke Jehovah ’ s commandments , a repentant sinner in ancient Israel could offer an animal sacrifice on God ’ s altar . ( Leviticus 4 :27-31 ) This sacrifice atoned for his sins but only in a provisional way .

7 By comparing himself to a shepherd , Jehovah assures us of his heartfelt desire to protect us . ( Ezekiel 34 :11-16 ) Recall the description of Jehovah found at Isaiah 40 :11 , discussed in Chapter 2 of this book : “ Like a shepherd he will shepherd his own drove . With his arm he will collect together the lambs ; and in his bosom he will carry them . ” How does the little lamb come to be in the shepherd ’ s “ bosom ” —the folds of his upper garment ? The lamb might approach the shepherd , even nudge his leg . However , it is the shepherd who must bend over , pick up the lamb , and gently place it in the security of his bosom . What a tender picture of the willingness of our Great Shepherd to shield and protect us !

22 “ Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness ’ sake , since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them . ” ( Matt . 5 :10 ) Expanding on this , Jesus added : “ Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake . Rejoice and leap for joy , since your reward is great in the heavens ; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ” —Matt . 5 :11 , 12 .

4 Chapter 11 of the book of Hebrews lists the names of 16 men and women of faith . The inspired writer referred to them and many others who “ received a favorable witness because of their faith . ” ( Heb . 11 :39 ) All of them had an “ assured expectation ” that God would raise up the promised “ offspring ” to crush Satan ’ s rebellion and to fulfill Jehovah ’ s original purpose . ( Gen . 3 :15 ) Those faithful ones died before the promised “ offspring , ” Jesus Christ , opened the way to heavenly life . ( Gal . 3 :16 ) Nevertheless , thanks to Jehovah ’ s unfailing promises , they will be resurrected to perfect human life in an earthly paradise .—Ps . 37 :11 ; Isa . 26 :19 ; Hos . 13 :14 .
10 Do we need to be in a special position when we pray ? No , Jehovah doesn ’ t ask us to kneel , sit , or stand when we pray . The Bible teaches us that we can talk to Jehovah in any respectful position . ( 1 Chronicles 17 :16 ; Nehemiah 8 :6 ; Daniel 6 :10 ; Mark 11 :25 ) What is most important to Jehovah is , not our position when we pray , but that we talk to him with the right attitude . We can pray out loud or silently wherever we are and at anytime during the day or night . When we pray to Jehovah , we can trust that he will hear us even when nobody else does .—Nehemiah 2 :1-6 .

10 Lessons we can apply : Are you a husband , a parent , or a congregation elder ? If so , you have a measure of authority . How important , then , that you imitate Jehovah by being considerate , kind , and patient when dealing with those under your care ! ( Col . 3 :19-21 ; 1 Pet . 5 :1-3 ) When you strive to imitate Jehovah and the Greater Moses , Jesus Christ , you will be both approachable and refreshing to others . ( Matt . 11 :28 , 29 ) You will also set an example worthy of imitation .—Heb . 13 :7 .

Emergency medical services (EMS) , also known as ambulance services or paramedic services , are emergency services which treat illnesses and injuries that require an urgent medical response , providing out-of-hospital treatment and transport to definitive care .
15 Jehovah has not given us a list of rules as to what we should or should not wear . Instead , he has provided us with Bible principles , which can help us to make good choices . ( Hebrews 5 :14 ) He wants us to base our decisions , whether big or small , on our love for him and others . ( Read Mark 12 :30 , 31 . ) All over the world , Jehovah ’ s people dress in different ways depending on their culture and on what they personally like . This variety is beautiful and refreshing .

64 “ Jehovah will scatter you among all the nations , from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth , and there you will have to serve gods of wood and of stone , which you and your forefathers have not known . 65 You will have no peace among those nations nor a place of rest for the sole of your foot . Rather , Jehovah will give you there an anxious heart and failing eyes and a feeling of despair . 66 Your life will be in great peril , and you will feel dread night and day ; and you will be uncertain of your survival . 67 In the morning you will say , ‘ If only it were evening ! ’ and in the evening you will say , ‘ If only it were morning ! ’ because of the dread you will feel in your heart and because of what your eyes will see . 68 And Jehovah will certainly bring you back to Egypt by ship , by the way that I told you , ‘ You will never see it again , ’ and there you will have to sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves , but there will be no buyer . ”
12 The Bible describes how much Jesus suffered before he died . He was cruelly whipped , nailed to a torture stake , and made to endure a slow and painful death . ( John 19 :1 , 16-18 , 30 ) Why did Jesus have to suffer so much ? Because Satan claimed that no human would be loyal to God if he was severely tested . Jesus proved that a perfect man can be loyal to God even if he suffers to the extreme . Imagine how proud Jehovah was of Jesus ! —Proverbs 27 :11 ; see Endnote 15 .

15 We do not have to make the same mistakes that Dinah made to learn that Jehovah ’ s moral standards are good for us . “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly . ” ( Proverbs 13 :20 ) Make it your goal to understand “ the entire course of what is good , ” and you will avoid unnecessary pain and suffering .—Proverbs 2 :6-9 ; Psalm 1 :1-3 .

15 Can we imitate Jesus ’ willingness to trust his disciples ? Some find it difficult to delegate responsibilities to others . They must always be at the helm , so to speak . They may think , ‘ If I want something done right , I must do it myself ! ’ But if we have to do everything ourselves , we are in danger of wearing ourselves out and perhaps taking unnecessary time away from our family . Besides , if we do not delegate appropriate tasks and responsibilities to others , we may be depriving them of needed experience and training . It would be wise to learn to trust others , delegating matters to them . We do well to ask ourselves honestly , ‘ Do I have the mind of Christ on this matter ? Do I willingly delegate certain tasks to others , trusting them to do their best ? ’

9 In the new world , we will experience to the full the blessings of the spiritual paradise . Then , our spiritual paradise will have its perfect counterpart—a literal paradise under the rulership of God ’ s Kingdom . During that time of global restoration , Jehovah will continue to mold earth ’ s inhabitants , educating them to a degree that we might now find hard to imagine . ( Isa . 11 :9 ) Furthermore , God will make our minds and bodies perfect , so that we will be able to absorb his teaching and do his will flawlessly . So let us be determined to continue submitting to Jehovah , showing him that we view his molding as an expression of his love for us .—Prov . 3 :11 , 12 .
5 Jim ’ s experience shows how pride can cause us to justify our actions , making us quite the opposite of malleable . ( Jer . 17 :9 ) “ I just could not stop focusing on how the others seemed to be wrong , ” explains Jim . Have you ever been hurt by a fellow Christian or by the loss of certain privileges ? If so , how did you respond ? Did pride come into play ? Or was your main concern that of making peace with your brother and remaining loyal to Jehovah ? —Read Psalm 119 :165 ; Colossians 3 :13 .

Since 1914 , human governments have become rivals to God ’ s Kingdom , which will soon execute judgment on the nations by destroying them . ( Ps . 2 :2 , 7-9 ) God lets the world ’ s political structure remain because it provides a measure of stability that , in turn , helps us to preach the good news of the Kingdom . ( Rom . 13 :3 , 4 ) God even directs us to pray concerning those in authority , especially when their decisions might affect our worship . ( 1 Tim . 2 :1 , 2 ) We appeal to government authorities for fair treatment , as the apostle Paul did . Although the Bible teaches that God ’ s adversary , Satan , has authority over political systems , it does not say that he directly controls each leader or official . ( Luke 4 :5 , 6 ) We should therefore avoid implying that a particular official is controlled by the Devil . Instead , when dealing with “ governments and authorities , ” we “ speak injuriously of no one . ” —Titus 3 :1 , 2 . w16 .04 4 :5 , 6

18 As you learn to love Jehovah , you will be moved to make a dedication to him and to do your best to live up to it . ( Ecclesiastes 5 :4 ) After making a dedication , surely you will want to “ walk worthily of Jehovah in order to please him fully . ” ( Colossians 1 :10 ) Because of your love for God , you will not think it is too hard to do his will . No doubt you will agree with the apostle John , who wrote : “ This is what the love of God means , that we observe his commandments ; and yet his commandments are not burdensome . ” —1 John 5 :3 .

“ You must stand before Caesar , ” an angel later told Paul . ( Acts 27 :24 ) Roman Emperor Nero had said at the beginning of his reign that he would not judge all cases himself . During the first eight years of his rule , he generally turned the task over to others . The book The Life and Epistles of Saint Paul reports that when Nero accepted a case for him to judge , he heard it in his own palace , where he was aided by a group of advisers who had a lot of experience and influence .

A Way of Respecting a Patient ’ s Dignity
CHAPTER 64
3 Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Eʹsau in the land of Seʹir , the territory of Eʹdom , 4 and he commanded them : “ This is what you will say to my lord , to Eʹsau , ‘ This is what your servant Jacob says : “ I have resided with Laʹban for a long time until now . 5 And I have acquired bulls , donkeys , sheep , and male and female servants , and I send this message to inform my lord , in order to find favor in your eyes . ” ’ ”
7 Jehovah also requires that those who approach him in prayer do so with humility and sincerity . Do we not have reason to be humble when speaking to Jehovah ? When people have the opportunity to speak to a king or a president , they usually do so respectfully , acknowledging the ruler ’ s high position . How much more so should we be respectful when approaching Jehovah ! ( Psalm 138 :6 ) After all , he is “ God Almighty . ” ( Genesis 17 :1 ) When we pray to God , the manner in which we approach him should show that we humbly recognize our position before him . Such humility will also move us to pray from our heart in sincerity , avoiding routine , repetitive prayers .—Matthew 6 :7 , 8 .
God ’ s people work hard to apply the Bible ’ s admonition : “ Deaden , therefore , your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality , uncleanness , uncontrolled sexual passion . ” ( Col . 3 :2 , 5 ) We would not want to make it difficult for fellow believers to heed that counsel . Brothers and sisters who have given up a sexually loose lifestyle may still be fighting sinful leanings . ( 1 Cor . 6 :9 , 10 ) We would not want to make their fight harder , would we ? When we are around our spiritual brothers and sisters , our manner of dress should help to make the congregation a haven of moral chastity . We have the freedom to choose what to wear . Still , all of us have a responsibility to wear clothes that make it easier for others to remain chaste and to maintain God ’ s standards of holiness in thought , word , and conduct .—1 Pet . 1 :15 , 16 . w16 .09 3 :9 , 10

HAVE you ever watched people select fruit ? Most observe its color and size to determine its ripeness . Some people smell the fruit . Others touch it , even squeeze it . Still others weigh it , putting one piece in each hand to detect which is heavier with juice . What are these people thinking ? They are analyzing details , evaluating differences , remembering previous selections , and comparing what they now see with what they already know . A tasty reward awaits them because they give careful attention to the matter .

10 Obscene language is displeasing to Jehovah and to those who love him . It is unclean . In the Bible , “ uncleanness ” is included in “ the works of the flesh . ” ( Galatians 5 :19-21 ) “ Uncleanness ” can include a wide variety of sins , and one unclean habit can lead to another . If a person made a habit of using extremely unclean , obscene language and refused to stop , this could indicate that he should no longer be part of the congregation .—2 Corinthians 12 :21 ; Ephesians 4 :19 ; see Endnote 23 .

8 A·bimʹe·lech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things , and they became very frightened . 9 Then A·bimʹe·lech called Abraham and said to him : “ What have you done to us ? What sin have I committed against you that you would bring upon me and my kingdom such a great sin ? What you have done to me was not right . ” 10 And A·bimʹe·lech went on to say to Abraham : “ What were your intentions when you did this thing ? ” 11 Abraham said : “ It was because I said to myself , ‘ Surely there is no fear of God in this place , and they will kill me because of my wife . ’ 12 And besides , she really is my sister , the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother , and she became my wife . 13 So when God caused me to wander from the house of my father , I said to her : ‘ Let this be how you show loyal love to me : Everywhere we go , say of me , “ He is my brother . ” ’ ”

At Psalm 104 :5 , the permanence of the earth is emphasized by two words used in the original Hebrew of that text—ʽoh·lamʹ for “ time indefinite ” and ʽadh for “ forever . ” ʽOh·lamʹ may be translated “ many years ” or “ perpetual . ” According to Harkavy ’ s Students ’ Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary , ʽadh means “ duration , everlastingness , eternity , for ever . ” These two Hebrew words show the durability of the earth to be doubly certain . Consider three further Bible-based reasons to believe that the earth will remain forever .

11 We have much to say about him , and it is difficult to explain , because you have become dull in your hearing . 12 For although by now you should be teachers , you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God , and you have gone back to needing milk , not solid food . 13 For everyone who continues to feed on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness , for he is a young child . 14 But solid food belongs to mature people , to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong .
12 Peter and John stopped in their flight , perhaps near the house of the former High Priest Annas , where Jesus was first taken for questioning . As Jesus was led from there , Peter and John followed but “ at a good distance . ” ( Matt . 26 :58 ; John 18 :12 , 13 ) Peter was no coward . It surely took a measure of courage to follow at all . The mob was armed , and Peter had already wounded one of them . Still , we do not here see in Peter ’ s example the kind of loyal love that he himself had professed—a willingness to die by his Master ’ s side if need be .—Mark 14 :31 .

6 What training did Jesus give his apostles , as mentioned at the outset ? According to Matthew chapter 10 , he gave them specific ministerial instruction , including the following : where to preach ( verses 5 , 6 ) , what message to share ( verse 7 ) , the need to put their trust in Jehovah ( verses 9 , 10 ) , how to approach householders ( verses 11-13 ) , how to handle rejection ( verses 14 , 15 ) , and how to respond when persecuted ( verses 16-23 ) .

I have done just as you told me . Sit up , please , and eat some of my game , so that you may bless me . ” 20 At that Isaac said to his son : “ How were you so quick in finding it , my son ? ” He replied : “ Because Jehovah your God brought it to me . ” 21 Then Isaac said to Jacob : “ Come near , please , that I may feel you , my son , to know whether you are really my son Eʹsau or not . ” 22 So Jacob came near to his father Isaac , and he felt him , after which he said : “ The voice is the voice of Jacob , but the hands are the hands of Eʹsau . ” 23 He did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of his brother Eʹsau . So he blessed him .

10 The World Book Encyclopedia says that the early Christians “ considered the celebration of anyone ’ s birth to be a pagan custom . ” Such customs were based on false beliefs . For example , the ancient Greeks believed that every person was protected by a spirit that was present at his birth . And they thought that spirit was connected to a god born on the same date as the person . In addition to such pagan beliefs , birthdays are also connected with astrology and horoscopes .
6 When facing trials , Paul continued to examine the Scriptures and derive strength from their inspired message . ( Heb . 4 :12 ) While imprisoned in Rome before his execution , Paul asked Timothy to bring him “ the scrolls ” and “ the parchments . ” ( 2 Tim . 4 :13 ) Those documents were likely portions of the Hebrew Scriptures that Paul used in his in-depth study . Acquiring knowledge of the Scriptures by having a routine of Bible study was essential to Paul so that he could remain steadfast .

8 In Jesus , Christian wives have a perfect model of submission to authority . What a difference there is between his view of authority and the attitude displayed by the first human wife ! Eve failed to provide a good model for wives to follow . She had a divinely commissioned head through whom Jehovah communicated instruction . Yet , Eve did not respect this arrangement . She failed to accept the instruction that Adam conveyed to her . ( Gen . 2 :16 , 17 ; 3 :3 ; 1 Cor . 11 :3 ) Granted , Eve was deceived ; yet she should have consulted her husband as to the propriety of heeding the voice that claimed to tell her what “ God knows . ” Instead , she presumed to direct her husband .—Gen . 3 :5 , 6 ; 1 Tim . 2 :14 .

9 Ever since the rebellion in Eden , any who have opposed Jehovah and his laws have been “ vessels of wrath made fit for destruction . ” During all the time since then , Jehovah has exercised long-suffering . The wicked have ridiculed his ways , persecuted his servants , even killed his Son . Showing great restraint , Jehovah has allowed enough time for all creation to see fully the disastrous results of rebellion against God and of human rule independent of him . At the same time , Jesus ’ death provided the means for delivering obedient mankind and for ‘ breaking up the works of the Devil . ’ —1 John 3 :8 ; Hebrews 2 :14 , 15 .

14 Some anxiety may be caused by a person ’ s past actions or failings . He may be plagued with guilt about something he did in the past , even many years ago . At times , King David felt that his ‘ errors loomed over his head . ’ He admitted : “ My anguished heart makes me groan aloud . ” ( Ps . 38 :3 , 4 , 8 , 18 ) In that situation , what was the wise thing for David to do ? What did he do ? He trusted in Jehovah ’ s mercy and forgiveness . With conviction he said : “ Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned . ” —Read Psalm 32 :1-3 , 5 .

10 Was Jesus upset that his privacy was disturbed ? Not at all ! His heart was touched by the sight of this crowd , numbering in the thousands , who awaited him . Mark wrote : “ He saw a great crowd , but he was moved with pity for them , because they were as sheep without a shepherd . And he started to teach them many things . ” Jesus saw these people as individuals having spiritual needs . They were like sheep straying helplessly , having no shepherd to guide or protect them . Jesus knew that the common people were neglected by the coldhearted religious leaders , who were supposed to be caring shepherds . ( John 7 :47-49 ) His heart went out to the people , so he began teaching them “ about the kingdom of God . ” ( Luke 9 :11 ) Notice that Jesus was moved with pity for the people even before seeing their reaction to what he would teach . In other words , tender compassion was , not the result of his teaching the crowd , but rather the motive for his doing so .
20 , 21 . Why can we be confident that Jehovah will always do what is right ?
19 Trust in Jehovah completely . ( Read Proverbs 3 :5 , 6 . ) We know that God knows exactly what we need and that he cares deeply about us . ( Psalm 37 :25 ; 1 Peter 5 :7 ) His Word tells us : “ Let your way of life be free of the love of money , while you are content with the present things . For [ God ] has said : ‘ I will never leave you , and I will never abandon you . ’ ” ( Hebrews 13 :5 ) Jehovah does not want us to worry constantly about providing for our family . Over and over again , he has shown that he can provide for his people ’ s needs . ( Matthew 6 :25-32 ) No matter what our work situation is , we regularly study God ’ s Word , preach the good news , and attend our Christian meetings .—Matthew 24 :14 ; Hebrews 10 :24 , 25 .

For dust you are and to dust you will return . ”
25 Therefore , now that you have put away deceit , each one of you speak truth with his neighbor , because we are members belonging to one another . 26 Be wrathful , but do not sin ; do not let the sun set while you are still angry ; 27 do not give the Devil an opportunity . 28 Let the one who steals steal no more ; rather , let him do hard work , doing good work with his hands , so that he may have something to share with someone in need . 29 Let a rotten word not come out of your mouth , but only what is good for building up as the need may be , to impart what is beneficial to the hearers . 30 Also , do not be grieving God ’ s holy spirit , with which you have been sealed for a day of releasing by ransom .

39 “ ‘ If your brother who lives nearby becomes poor and he has to sell himself to you , you must not force him to do slave labor . 40 He should be treated like a hired worker , like a settler . He should serve with you until the Jubilee year . 41 Then he will leave you , he and his children with him , and return to his family . He should return to the property of his forefathers . 42 For they are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt . They should not sell themselves the way a slave is sold . 43 You must not treat him cruelly , and you must be in fear of your God . 44 Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you , from them you may buy a male or a female slave . 45 Also from the sons of the foreign settlers who are residing with you , from them and from their families that are born to them in your land you may buy slaves , and they will become your possession . 46 You may pass them on as an inheritance to your sons after you to inherit as a permanent possession . You may use them as workers , but you must not subject your Israelite brothers to cruel treatment .
4 Seeing God ’ s name there has caused many to peer deeper into the Bible . Others have decided to study the Bible when shown what it says about the purpose of life , why God permits wickedness , the significance of current events , or the hope of eternal life on a paradise earth . In lands where religious practices have exposed people to harassment by evil spirits , the Bible ’ s explanation of what causes this and how to gain relief has aroused interest . Why do these points impress sincere people ? Because the Bible is the only source of reliable information on all such vital matters .—Psalm 119 :130 .

2 Jehovah expects us to put our abilities to good use . Why ? Because he loves us , and he knows that it brings us satisfaction when we employ these gifts . Through his Word , Jehovah repeatedly admonishes us to use our abilities for good . For example , in the Hebrew Scriptures , we read : “ The plans of the diligent surely lead to success ” ; and “ whatever your hand finds to do , do with all your might . ” ( Prov . 21 :5 ; Eccl . 9 :10 ) In the Christian Greek Scriptures , we are told : “ As long as we have the opportunity , let us work what is good toward all ” ; and “ to the extent that each one has received a gift , use it in ministering to one another . ” ( Gal . 6 :10 ; 1 Pet . 4 :10 ) Clearly , Jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others .

Discouraged and bewildered during those difficult years , some Bible Students had left off the witness work . Most , though , had done their best to persevere in the face of official suppression . In one typical case , an investigator reported that despite stern warnings , the Bible Students he questioned insisted that they would “ continue to preach the word of God to the end . ”
20 The International Handbook on Alcohol and Culture says that toasting probably comes from an ancient pagan custom “ in which a sacred liquid was offered to the gods . ” This was done “ in exchange for a wish , a prayer summarized in the words ‘ long life ! ’ or ‘ to your health ! ’ ” In ancient times , people used to raise their cups to ask their gods for a blessing . But that is not how Jehovah provides blessings .—John 14 :6 ; 16 :23 .
4 The king now said to A·maʹsa : “ Call the men of Judah together to me within three days , and you also should be here . ” 5 So A·maʹsa went to call Judah together , but he came later than the set time that had been appointed for him . 6 Then David said to A·bishʹai : “ Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri may do us more harm than Abʹsa·lom did . Take the servants of your lord and chase after him , so that he may not find fortified cities and escape from us . ” 7 So the men of Joʹab , the Cherʹe·thites , the Pelʹe·thites , and all the mighty men went out after him ; they left Jerusalem to chase after Sheʹba the son of Bichʹri . 8 When they were near the great stone in Gibʹe·on , A·maʹsa came to meet them . Now Joʹab was wearing his battle clothing , and he had a sword in its sheath strapped to his hip . When he stepped forward , the sword fell out .

Some who are learning God ’ s ways have had a limited education . They may need to be taught to read in order to improve their spiritual advancement . Or they may need personal assistance in improving their reading skills . Where there is a local need , congregations endeavor to organize literacy classes based on the publication Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing . Many thousands have benefited greatly from this provision . Because of the importance of being able to read well , some congregations arrange for reading-improvement classes to be held in conjunction with the Theocratic Ministry School . Even where such classes are not available , a person can make good progress by taking some time each day to read aloud and by regularly attending and participating in the school .

Jeʹhu now said : “ If you agree , do not let anyone escape from the city to go and report this in Jezʹre·el . ” 16 Then Jeʹhu mounted his chariot and went to Jezʹre·el , for Je·hoʹram was lying there wounded , and King A·ha·ziʹah of Judah had gone down to see Je·hoʹram . 17 As the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezʹre·el , he saw the throng of Jeʹhu ’ s men approaching . At once he said : “ I see a throng of men . ” Je·hoʹram said : “ Take a cavalryman and send him to meet them , and let him say , ‘ Are you coming in peace ? ’ ” 18 So a horseman went to meet him and said : “ This is what the king says , ‘ Are you coming in peace ? ’ ” But Jeʹhu said : “ What do you have to do with ‘ peace ’ ? Fall in behind me ! ”

17 If unity and cleanness are to be maintained in a congregation , the elders must care for judicial matters promptly and in a loving way . Paul knew that God ’ s love is not guided by mere sentiment , and He does not turn a blind eye to wrongdoing . ( Prov . 15 :3 ) So Paul did not hold back from writing First Corinthians , a strong yet loving letter . Second Corinthians , written some months later , shows that progress was made because the elders had applied the apostle ’ s direction . If a Christian takes a false step before he is aware of it , qualified men should try to readjust him in a spirit of mildness .—Gal . 6 :1 .
5 You may have heard the expression , “ Power corrupts . ” Throughout history , many humans have abused their power . ( Read Ecclesiastes 8 :9 . ) For example , Saul was a good and humble man when Jehovah chose him to be king of Israel . But he allowed pride and jealousy to grow in his heart , and this led him to persecute David , an innocent man . ( 1 Samuel 9 :20 , 21 ; 10 :20-22 ; 18 :7-11 ) Later , David became king , and he was one of the best kings Israel ever had . Still , in time , even David abused his power . He had sexual relations with Bath-sheba , the wife of a man named Uriah , and then tried to hide his sin by sending Uriah to be killed in battle .—2 Samuel 11 :1-17 .

10 The religious leaders buried God ’ s Law under a mass of man-made rules and regulations . The Sabbath law , for instance , simply forbade work on the Sabbath , setting that day aside for worship , spiritual refreshment , and rest . But the Pharisees made a burden of that law . They took it upon themselves to decide just what “ work ” meant . They labeled as work 39 different activities , such as reaping or hunting . These categories gave rise to endless questions . If a man killed a flea on the Sabbath , was he hunting ? If he plucked a handful of grain to eat as he walked along , was he reaping ? If he healed someone who was ill , was he working ? Such questions were addressed with rigid , detailed rules .

18 The first-century governing body proved to be a source of encouragement both to those taking the lead and to Christians in general . When Philip the evangelizer preached about Christ to the Samaritans , he received the full backing of those on the governing body . They sent two of their number , Peter and John , to pray for the new believers to receive holy spirit . ( Acts 8 :5 , 14-17 ) How Philip himself as well as those he had converted must have been encouraged by this support from the governing body !

10 For personal Bible study to have a powerful impact on us , it should be done in such a way that the Bible ’ s message reaches deep inside us , affecting our inner person . For example , the prophet Ezekiel was given a vision in which he was asked to eat the roll of a book containing a strong message to be delivered to an unreceptive people . Ezekiel was to absorb the message fully and make it part of him . Doing so would make the task of delivering that message pleasant—like the taste of honey .—Read Ezekiel 2 :8–3 :4 , 7-9 .

This should be done for both of them , and they will form the two corner posts . 25 And there will be eight panel frames and their 16 silver socket pedestals , two socket pedestals under the one panel frame and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame .

Think about this : Satan , “ the ruler of this world , ” would like nothing more than to eliminate true worship . ( John 12 :31 ; Revelation 12 :17 ) Some of the most powerful governments on earth have banned our preaching work and have tried to wipe us out completely . Yet , Jehovah ’ s people have remained firm and have continued to preach without letup ! Why have mighty nations been unable to put a stop to the activity of this relatively small and seemingly defenseless group of Christians ? Because Jehovah has shielded us with his powerful wings ! —Psalm 17 :7 , 8 .

Yes , I have acted foolishly and have made a terrible mistake . ” 22 David answered : “ Here is the spear of the king . Let one of the young men come over and take it . 23 It is Jehovah who will repay each one for his own righteousness and his own faithfulness , for today Jehovah gave you into my hand , but I was unwilling to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah . 24 Look ! Just as your life was precious to me this day , so may my life be precious in the eyes of Jehovah , and may he rescue me out of all distress . ” 25 Saul replied to David : “ May you be blessed , my son David . You will surely do great things , and you will surely prevail . ” Then David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .

6 From the inspired Bible record then available , David knew that the righteous can count on Jehovah to help them . When Jehovah brought the Deluge upon an ungodly world , he preserved alive Noah and his God-fearing family . ( Gen . 7 :23 ) When Jehovah rained down fire and sulfur upon the wicked inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah , he helped righteous Lot and his two daughters to escape with their lives . ( Gen . 19 :12-26 ) When Jehovah destroyed proud Pharaoh and his military forces in the Red Sea , He kept his people safe , thus helping them to escape a terrible end . ( Ex . 14 :19-28 ) Is it any wonder , then , that David in another psalm extolled Jehovah as “ a God of saving acts ” ? —Ps . 68 :20 .

27 When King A·ha·ziʹah of Judah saw what was happening , he fled by way of the garden house . ( Later Jeʹhu pursued him and said : “ Strike him down also ! ” So they struck him down in the chariot on his way up to Gur , which is by Ibʹle·am . But he continued his flight to Me·gidʹdo and died there . 28 Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem , and they buried him in his grave with his forefathers in the City of David . 29 It was in the 11th year of Je·hoʹram the son of Aʹhab that A·ha·ziʹah had become king over Judah . )
12 Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt : 2 “ This month will be the beginning of the months for you . It will be the first of the months of the year for you . 3 Speak to the entire assembly of Israel , saying , ‘ On the tenth day of this month , they should each take for themselves a sheep for their father ’ s house , a sheep to a house . 4 But if the household is too small for the sheep , they and their nearest neighbor should share it between themselves in their house according to the number of people . When making the calculation , determine how much of the sheep each one will eat . 5 Your sheep should be a sound , one-year-old male . You may choose from the young rams or from the goats . 6 You must care for it until the 14th day of this month , and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it at twilight . 7 They must take some of the blood and splash it on the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway of the houses in which they eat it .

3 Then Moses said to the people : “ Remember this day on which you went out of Egypt , from the house of slavery , because with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of here . So nothing leavened may be eaten . 4 You are going out on this day , in the month of Aʹbib . 5 When Jehovah has brought you into the land of the Caʹnaan·ites , the Hitʹtites , the Amʹor·ites , the Hiʹvites , and the Jebʹu·sites , which he swore to your forefathers to give you , a land flowing with milk and honey , then you must keep this observance in this month . 6 Seven days you are to eat unleavened bread , and on the seventh day , there will be a festival to Jehovah . 7 Unleavened bread is to be eaten for the seven days ; and nothing leavened is to be found with you , and no sourdough is to be found with you within all your territory . 8 And you must tell your son on that day , ‘ It is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came out of Egypt . ’ 9 And this will serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial on your forehead , so that Jehovah ’ s law may be in your mouth , for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of Egypt . 10 You must keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year .

Therefore , the Abrahamic covenant remained in effect after the Law was “ abolished . ” ( Eph . 2 :15 ) Its promises are passed on to Abraham ’ s true “ seed ” —Christ Jesus , who is the primary one , and those who “ belong to Christ . ”
9 All of these were made of expensive stones hewn according to measure , trimmed with stonesaws inside and out , from the foundation up to the coping , and outside as far as the great courtyard . 10 And the foundation was laid with very large , expensive stones ; some stones measured ten cubits , and other stones , eight cubits . 11 And above these were expensive stones , hewn according to measure , as well as cedar . 12 Around the great courtyard were three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams , like that for the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah and the porch of the house .
13 Jesus sometimes combined methods by weaving thought-provoking questions into his illustrations . When a Jewish lawyer asked Jesus what was required to gain everlasting life , Jesus referred him to the Mosaic Law , which commands love of God and neighbor . Wanting to prove himself righteous , the man asked : “ Who really is my neighbor ? ” Jesus answered by telling a story . A certain Jewish man was traveling alone when he was assaulted by robbers , who left him half dead . Along came two Jews , first a priest and then a Levite . Both ignored him . But then a certain Samaritan came upon the scene . Moved with pity , he gently dressed the victim ’ s wounds and lovingly carried the man to the safety of an inn where he could recover . Concluding the story , Jesus asked his inquirer : “ Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man that fell among the robbers ? ” The man was compelled to answer : “ The one that acted mercifully toward him . ” —Luke 10 :25-37 .

3 We proclaim the same truths that Jesus did , and upon hearing them , people react to us today as many did to him back then . This is to be expected . Jesus said to his disciples : “ A slave is not greater than his master . If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also . ” ( John 15 :20 ) In many lands we do not face outright persecution , but we do meet with disdain and apathy . Consequently , we need faith and courage to endure in our work of preaching the good news with boldness .—Read 2 Peter 1 :5-8 .

Take a moment to think about the path along which you are traveling . Is it the right one ? Where is it headed ? Seek Jehovah ’ s guidance in prayer . Consult the ‘ road map , ’ the Bible . You may even feel the need to consult an experienced traveler , one who has been endeavoring to walk in God ’ s way . If you thus see the need to change direction , do so quickly .
8 Moses then said to Korʹah : “ Listen , please , you sons of Leʹvi . 9 Does it seem to you such a little thing that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel and allowed you to approach him in order to perform the service of Jehovah ’ s tabernacle and to stand before the assembly to minister to them , 10 and that he brought you near to him along with all your brothers , the sons of Leʹvi ? Must you also try to secure the priesthood ? 11 For this reason , you and all your supporters who are gathering together are against Jehovah . As for Aaron , who is he that you should murmur against him ? ”
41 Ad·o·niʹjah and all those invited by him heard it when they had finished eating . As soon as Joʹab heard the sound of the horn , he said : “ Why is there such a noisy uproar in the city ? ” 42 While he was still speaking , Jonʹa·than the son of A·biʹa·thar the priest came . Then Ad·o·niʹjah said : “ Come in , for you are a good man , and you must bring good news . ” 43 But Jonʹa·than answered Ad·o·niʹjah : “ No ! Our lord King David has made Solʹo·mon king . 44 The king sent with him Zaʹdok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da , and the Cherʹe·thites and the Pelʹe·thites , and they had him ride on the mule of the king . 45 Then Zaʹdok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king in Giʹhon . After that they came up from there rejoicing , and the city is in an uproar . That was the noise that you heard . 46 Moreover , Solʹo·mon has sat down on the royal throne . 47 Another thing , the servants of the king have come in to congratulate our lord King David , saying , ‘ May your God make Solʹo·mon ’ s name more splendid than your name , and may He make his throne greater than your throne ! ’ At that the king bowed down on the bed . 48 And the king also said , ‘ May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised , who today has granted someone to sit on my throne and has allowed my own eyes to see it ! ’ ”
25 “ If , however , the man happened to meet the engaged girl in the field and the man overpowered her and lay down with her , the man who lay down with her is to die by himself , 26 and you must do nothing to the girl . The girl has not committed a sin deserving of death . This case is the same as when a man attacks his fellow man and murders him . 27 For he happened to meet her in the field , and the engaged girl screamed , but there was no one to rescue her .

16 When Jo·siʹah turned and saw the graves on the mountain , he had the bones taken from the graves and burned them on the altar , making it unfit for worship , according to Jehovah ’ s word that had been proclaimed by the man of the true God who foretold that these things would happen . 17 Then he said : “ What is the gravestone over there that I am looking at ? ” At this the men of the city said to him : “ It is the grave of the man of the true God from Judah who foretold these things that you have done against the altar of Bethʹel . ” 18 So he said : “ Let him rest . Do not let anyone disturb his bones . ” So they left his bones undisturbed , as well as the bones of the prophet who had come from Sa·marʹi·a .

14 So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin bottle of water and gave it to Haʹgar . He set these on her shoulder and then sent her away along with the boy . So she departed and wandered about in the wilderness of Beʹer-sheʹba . 15 Finally the water in the skin bottle was used up , and she pushed the boy under one of the bushes . 16 Then she went on and sat down by herself , about the distance of a bowshot away , because she said : “ I do not want to watch the boy die . ” So she sat down at a distance and began to cry aloud and to weep .

14 Malachi 3 :1-3 describes the time—from 1914 to early 1919—when the anointed “ sons of Levi ” would undergo a period of refinement . ( Read . ) During that time , Jehovah God , “ the true Lord , ” accompanied by Jesus Christ , “ the messenger of the covenant , ” came to the spiritual temple to inspect those serving there . After receiving needed discipline , Jehovah ’ s cleansed people were ready to take up a further assignment of service . In 1919 , a “ faithful and discreet slave ” was appointed to provide spiritual food to the household of faith . ( Matt . 24 :45 ) God ’ s people were now free of the influence of Babylon the Great . Since that time , by Jehovah ’ s undeserved kindness , his people have constantly been growing in knowledge of God ’ s will and in love for their heavenly Father . How grateful they are for his blessing ! [ 1 ]

10 In his infinite goodness , Jehovah has given us a body that is “ wonderfully made , ” with senses designed to help us perceive his works and delight in them . ( Psalm 139 :14 ) Think again of those scenes described at the outset of this chapter . What sights bring joy to such moments ? The flushed cheeks of a delighted child . The curtains of rain descending on the fields . The reds , golds , and violets of a sunset . The human eye is designed to detect over 300 ,000 different colors ! And our sense of hearing catches the nuances of tone in a well-loved voice , the whisper of the wind through the trees , the toddler ’ s ecstatic laugh . Why are we able to enjoy such sights and sounds ? The Bible says : “ The hearing ear and the seeing eye—Jehovah himself has made even both of them . ” ( Proverbs 20 :12 ) But those are only two of the senses .

16 Especially were the Jewish religious leaders highly critical of others . To illustrate : When a certain blind man who was healed by Christ declared that Jesus must have come from God , the Pharisees retorted : “ You were altogether born in sins , and yet are you teaching us ? ” ( John 9 :30-34 ) As regards clear spiritual vision and the ability to judge properly , the Pharisees had “ a rafter ” in their own eye and were totally blind . Jesus therefore exclaimed : “ Hypocrite ! First extract the rafter from your own eye , and then you will see clearly how to extract the straw from your brother ’ s eye . ” ( Matt . 7 :5 ; Luke 6 :42 ) If we are determined to do good and treat others well , we will not be harsh critics , always looking for a figurative straw in our brother ’ s eye . Instead , we will acknowledge that we are imperfect and should therefore avoid being judgmental and critical of our fellow believers .
10 We also respect authority because it is in our own best interests to do so . When Jehovah asks us to respect authority , he often mentions the benefits that will come to us for doing so . For instance , he tells children to obey their parents in order to live a long and good life . ( Deuteronomy 5 :16 ; Ephesians 6 :2 , 3 ) He tells us to respect congregation elders because failure to do so will cause us spiritual harm . ( Hebrews 13 :7 , 17 ) And he tells us to obey secular authorities for our own protection .—Romans 13 :4 .

25 See that you do not refuse to listen to the one who is speaking . For if those who refused to listen to the one giving divine warning on earth did not escape , how much more will we not escape if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens ! 26 At that time his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised : “ Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven . ” 27 Now the expression “ yet once more ” indicates the removal of the things that are shaken , things that have been made , in order that the things not shaken may remain . 28 Therefore , seeing that we are to receive a Kingdom that can not be shaken , let us continue to receive undeserved kindness , through which we may acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe . 29 For our God is a consuming fire .

Wholesome meditation gives us inner depth , quiet reserve , and moral strength—all of which add insight and understanding to our speech and behavior . ( Proverbs 16 :23 ) Such meditation , therefore , also contributes to a happy and rewarding life . Concerning the person who regularly meditates on God , Psalm 1 :3 states : “ He will be like a tree planted by streams of water , a tree that produces fruit in its season , the foliage of which does not wither . And everything he does will succeed . ”

About six months earlier in his hometown of Capernaum , Peter approached Jesus and asked : “ Lord , how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him ? Up to seven times ? ” Peter likely thought that he was being generous . After all , the religious leaders of the day taught that one had to forgive only three times ! Jesus replied : “ Not , Up to seven times , but , Up to seventy-seven times . ” —Matthew 18 :21 , 22 .
Communication
For example , I gave my first public talk as a circuit overseer in front of a village store out in the open . I soon learned that it was the custom in the Philippines in those days for a public talk to be really public ! As I visited different congregations in the circuit , I delivered talks in public gazebos , at markets , in front of municipal halls , on basketball courts , in parks , and often on city street corners . Once in San Pablo City , a downpour prevented me from giving a talk at a public market , so I suggested to the responsible brothers that it be given in the Kingdom Hall . Afterward , the brothers asked whether this could be reported as a public meeting , since it was not held in a public place !

19 We are grateful to Jehovah for his wonderful gift of life ! And we want to tell people that if they have faith in Jesus , they can live forever . We love people , and we will do everything we can to teach them how to get life . ( Ezekiel 3 :17-21 ) Then , like the apostle Paul , we will be able to say : “ I am clean from the blood of all men , for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God . ” ( Acts 20 :26 , 27 ) Yes , we show that we deeply respect life and blood when we tell others about Jehovah and how precious life is to him .

11 It was fitting for Christians in Rome to analyze what their focus in life really was . Could it be that their lives were dominated by or centered on “ things of the flesh ” ? And it is fitting for us to consider the same about our lives . What is of greatest interest to us , and to what does our speech gravitate ? What do we really pursue day in and day out ? Some may find that they are focusing on trying different types of wine , decorating the home , finding new clothing styles , making investments , planning vacation trips , and the like . Such matters are not bad in themselves ; they can be normal aspects of life . For example , Jesus once made wine , and Paul told Timothy to take “ a little wine . ” ( 1 Tim . 5 :23 ; John 2 :3-11 ) But did Jesus and Paul “ constantly talk about , engage and glory in ” wine ? Was it their passion , what they ‘ constantly talked ’ about ? No . What about us ? What is our key interest in life ?

14 When Jeremiah returned from Toʹpheth where Jehovah sent him to prophesy , he stood in the courtyard of the house of Jehovah and said to all the people : 15 “ This is what Jehovah of armies , the God of Israel , says , ‘ Here I am bringing on this city and on all its towns all the calamity that I have spoken against it , because they stubbornly refused to obey my words . ’ ”

Through his written Word , Jehovah has given us a number of specific commands . For example , he forbids sexual immorality , idolatry , stealing , and drunkenness . ( 1 Cor . 6 :9 , 10 ) Additionally , God ’ s Son , Jesus Christ , gave his followers this challenging , though thrilling , command : “ Go , . . . and make disciples of people of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit , teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you . And look ! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things . ” ( Matt . 28 :19 , 20 ) What a protection divine laws and commandments have proved to be ! Obeying them has increased our self-respect , contributed to good health , and enhanced family happiness . More important , our loyal adherence to Jehovah ’ s commands , including the command to share in the preaching work , has brought us his approval and blessing . w16 .05 3 :1
, Ge 2 :24 leave mother and s . to his wife
One of the limitations on our freedom is that we must respect the right that others have to make their own decisions in life . Why ? Since we all have the gift of free will , no two Christians will always make exactly the same decision . This is true even in matters that involve our conduct and worship . When we recognize that each Christian must “ carry his own load , ” we will respect the right that others have to use their own gift of free will , including when making personal decisions in matters of lesser importance . ( 1 Cor . 10 :32 , 33 ) Jehovah has given us the gift of free will and with it true freedom . ( 2 Cor . 3 :17 ) We treasure this gift because it allows us to make decisions that reveal to Jehovah how much we love him . May we continue to show our appreciation for this precious gift by using it in a way that honors God and by respecting the way that others choose to use their gift . w17 .01 2 :15 , 17 , 18
21 When they told it to Saul , he immediately sent other messengers , and they too began behaving as prophets . So Saul sent messengers again , a third group , and they too began behaving as prophets . 22 Finally he also went to Raʹmah . When he reached the great cistern that is in Seʹcu , he asked : “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” They replied : “ There in Naiʹoth in Raʹmah . ” 23 While Saul was on his way from there to Naiʹoth in Raʹmah , the spirit of God came upon him as well , and he walked along behaving as a prophet until he came into Naiʹoth in Raʹmah . 24 He also stripped off his garments , and he too behaved as a prophet before Samuel , and he lay there naked all that day and all that night . That is why they say : “ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ”

18 Jehovah will not personally tell us to say something encouraging to a particular individual as he told Moses to encourage and strengthen Joshua . Yet , God is pleased when we speak encouragingly to fellow believers and others . ( Prov . 19 :17 ; Heb . 12 :12 ) For instance , we might tell a public speaker how his talk gave us advice we needed or helped us to understand a certain scripture . “ Although we spoke for only a few minutes , ” wrote a sister to a visiting speaker , “ you saw my heavy heart , and you comforted and uplifted me . I want you to know that when you spoke in such a kind way , both from the platform and in person , I felt that it was a gift from Jehovah . ”

Satan uses his world ’ s commercial system to seduce us into believing that having material things beyond our actual needs is necessary for the enjoyment of life . He is adept at appealing to “ the desire of the eyes . ” ( 1 John 2 :15-17 ; Gen . 3 :6 ; Prov . 27 :20 ) The world offers every kind of material thing , from the superb to the absurd , some of which look very enticing . Have you ever purchased something , not because you needed it , but because it caught your eye in an advertisement or a store display ? Did you later realize that you could have lived the rest of your life without it ? Such nonessential things only complicate our life and weigh us down . They can ensnare us and distract us from our spiritual routine of studying the Bible , preparing for and attending meetings , and sharing regularly in the ministry . Remember , the apostle John warned : “ The world is passing away and so is its desire . ” w16 .07 1 :3 , 4

19 So the Rabʹsha·keh said to them : “ Please , say to Hez·e·kiʹah , ‘ This is what the great king , the king of As·syrʹi·a , says : “ What is the basis for your confidence ? 20 You are saying , ‘ I have a strategy and the power to wage war , ’ but these are empty words . In whom have you put your trust , so that you dare to rebel against me ? 21 Look ! You trust in the support of this crushed reed , Egypt , which if a man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it . That is the way Pharʹaoh king of Egypt is to all those who trust in him . 22 And if you should say to me , ‘ We trust in Jehovah our God , ’ is he not the one whose high places and altars Hez·e·kiʹah has removed , while he says to Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You should bow down before this altar in Jerusalem ’ ? ” ’ 23 So now make this wager , please , with my lord the king of As·syrʹi·a : I will give you 2 ,000 horses if you are able to find enough riders for them . 24 How , then , could you drive back even one governor who is the least of my lord ’ s servants , while you put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ? 25 Now is it without authorization from Jehovah that I have come up against this place to destroy it ? Jehovah himself said to me , ‘ Go up against this land and destroy it . ’ ”

7 In my distress I called on Jehovah ,
YOU are involved in the most important issue ever to face mankind . Where you stand on it will determine your everlasting future . This issue was raised when rebellion broke out in Eden . Back then Satan asked Eve : “ Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden ? ” She replied that concerning one tree God had said : “ You must not eat from it . . . that you do not die . ” Then Satan directly charged Jehovah with lying , saying that neither Eve ’ s life nor Adam ’ s life was dependent on obedience to God . Satan claimed that God was withholding from his creatures something good—the ability to set their own standards in life . Satan asserted : “ God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God , knowing good and bad . ” —Genesis 3 :1-5 .
8 Just as your deep love for God moves you to obey the commands to preach and to meet together despite obstacles , so your love for Jehovah can move you to obey the Scriptural exhortation to “ let [ your ] marriage be honorable , ” even when that appears to be difficult . ( Hebrews 13 :4 ; Psalm 18 :29 ; Ecclesiastes 5 :4 ) Additionally , just as your efforts to share in preaching and in meeting together bring rich blessings from God , so your efforts to honor your marriage will be noticed and blessed by Jehovah .—1 Thessalonians 1 :3 ; Hebrews 6 :10 .
However , all credit belongs to Jehovah .—Ps . 115 :1 .
22 Samuel then said : “ Does Jehovah take as much pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah ? Look ! To obey is better than a sacrifice , and to pay attention than the fat of rams ; 23 for rebelliousness is the same as the sin of divination , and pushing ahead presumptuously the same as using magical power and idolatry . Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah , he has rejected you from being king . ”

14 Malachi 3 :1-3 describes the time—from 1914 to early 1919—when the anointed “ sons of Levi ” would undergo a period of refinement . ( Read . ) During that time , Jehovah God , “ the true Lord , ” accompanied by Jesus Christ , “ the messenger of the covenant , ” came to the spiritual temple to inspect those serving there . After receiving needed discipline , Jehovah ’ s cleansed people were ready to take up a further assignment of service . In 1919 , a “ faithful and discreet slave ” was appointed to provide spiritual food to the household of faith . ( Matt . 24 :45 ) God ’ s people were now free of the influence of Babylon the Great . Since that time , by Jehovah ’ s undeserved kindness , his people have constantly been growing in knowledge of God ’ s will and in love for their heavenly Father . How grateful they are for his blessing ! [ 1 ]

WHO has the authority to set the standards of right and wrong ? That question was raised at the very beginning of human history . According to the Bible book of Genesis , God designated a tree that was growing in the garden of Eden as “ the tree of the knowledge of good and bad . ” ( Genesis 2 :9 ) God instructed the first human pair not to eat the fruit from this tree . However , God ’ s enemy , Satan the Devil , suggested that if they ate from this tree , their eyes were “ bound to be opened ” and they were “ bound to be like God , knowing good and bad . ” —Genesis 2 :16 , 17 ; 3 :1 , 5 ; Revelation 12 :9 .

Then all the remnant of Judah who came to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word has come true , mine or theirs ! ” ’ ”

2 Whether they know it or not , such people are all benefiting from the same thing—the goodness of Jehovah God . Religious people often repeat the phrase “ God is good . ” The Bible is far more emphatic . It says : “ O how great his goodness is ! ” ( Zechariah 9 :17 ) But it seems that few today really know what those words mean . What does the goodness of Jehovah God actually involve , and how does this quality of God affect each one of us ?

6 As we considered in Chapter 9 , Isaiah foretold that Jehovah would bless his people with an increase in numbers . ( Isa . 60 :22 ) However , Jehovah promised to do even more .

So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the Sabbath . ” 13 Then he said to the man : “ Stretch out your hand . ” And he stretched it out , and it was restored sound like the other hand . 14 But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him to kill him . 15 Having come to know this , Jesus departed from there . Many also followed him , and he cured them all , 16 but he sternly ordered them not to make him known , 17 in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , who said :

“ HE HAS never once been seen to laugh . ” That is how Jesus is described in a document falsely claiming to be written by an ancient Roman official . This document , which has been known in its present form since about the 11th century , is said to have influenced many artists . In a number of paintings , Jesus appears as a solemn-looking person who rarely , if ever , smiled . But that is hardly a fair depiction of Jesus , whom the Gospels portray as a warm , kindhearted man of deep feelings .

25 The word of Jehovah again came to me , saying : 2 “ Son of man , turn your face toward the Amʹmon·ites , and prophesy against them . 3 You must say concerning the Amʹmon·ites , ‘ Hear the word of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah . This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says : “ Because you said ‘ Aha ! ’ against my sanctuary when it was profaned , and against the land of Israel when it was laid desolate , and against the house of Judah when they went into exile , 4 therefore I am giving you to the people of the East as a possession . They will set up their encampments within you and pitch their tents among you . They will eat your fruitage , and they will drink your milk . 5 I will make Rabʹbah a pasture ground for camels , and the land of the Amʹmon·ites a resting-place for the flock ; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah . ” ’ ”
16 When the men got up to leave and looked down toward Sodʹom , Abraham was walking with them to escort them . 17 Jehovah said : “ Am I keeping hidden from Abraham what I am going to do ? 18 Why , Abraham is surely going to become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed by means of him . 19 For I have come to know him in order that he may command his sons and his household after him to keep Jehovah ’ s way by doing what is right and just , so that Jehovah may bring about what he has promised concerning Abraham . ”

18 But what are some things that Jehovah tells us are wrong ? There are some examples in the box “ Hate What Jehovah Hates . ” At first , you might think that some of these things are not so bad . But when you read the Bible verses and carefully think about them , you will understand the wisdom of obeying Jehovah ’ s laws . You may also feel that you need to make some changes in your life . Even though this may be difficult at times , if you make those changes , you will have the peace and happiness that come from being a loyal friend of God . ( Isaiah 48 :17 , 18 ) How do we know that it is possible to make these changes ?
And I will turn my hand against those who are insignificant . ”

Its radiance was like a most precious stone , like a jasper stone shining crystal clear . 12 It had a great and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates , and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel . 13 On the east were three gates , and on the north three gates , and on the south three gates , and on the west three gates . 14 The wall of the city also had 12 foundation stones , and on them were the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb .

What is study ? It is more than superficial reading . It involves using your mental faculties in careful or extended consideration of a subject . It includes analyzing what you read , comparing it with what you already know , and taking note of reasons given for statements made . When studying , think deeply on any ideas expressed that may be new to you . Consider , too , how you might personally apply Scriptural counsel more fully . As a Witness of Jehovah , you will also want to think about opportunities to use the material to help others . Obviously , study includes meditation .
12 But what I am doing I will continue to do , in order to eliminate the pretext of those who are wanting a basis for being found equal to us in the things about which they boast . 13 For such men are false apostles , deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ . 14 And no wonder , for Satan himself keeps disguising himself as an angel of light . 15 It is therefore nothing extraordinary if his ministers also keep disguising themselves as ministers of righteousness . But their end will be according to their works .

2 However , our sinful leanings , our upbringing , and other factors make it a challenge to accept discipline or to view it in the right light . We build appreciation for discipline when we experience its benefits , which confirm God ’ s love for us . “ My son , do not reject the discipline of Jehovah , . . . for those whom Jehovah loves he reproves , ” says Proverbs 3 :11 , 12 . Yes , let us never forget that Jehovah has our best interests at heart . ( Read Hebrews 12 :5-11 . ) Because God fully knows us , his discipline is always appropriate and properly measured . Let us now examine four aspects of discipline : ( 1 ) self-discipline , ( 2 ) parental discipline , ( 3 ) discipline within the Christian congregation , and ( 4 ) something that is worse than the temporary pain of discipline .

8 Finally , when we pray about something , we must do everything we can to work at what we are praying for . For example , if we pray to Jehovah for our daily needs , then we can ’ t be lazy and expect Jehovah to give us everything even though we are able to work for it . We must work hard and accept whatever job we are able to do . ( Matthew 6 :11 ; 2 Thessalonians 3 :10 ) Or if we pray to Jehovah for help to stop doing something wrong , we must avoid any situation that could tempt us . ( Colossians 3 :5 ) Let ’ s now examine some common questions about prayer .

7 In 1914 alone , the small number of Bible Students presented the “ Photo-Drama of Creation ” to more than 9 ,000 ,000 people . The Drama , as it was called , combined pictures and slides synchronized with sound and traced man ’ s history from the time of creation to the end of the Millennium . It was an outstanding achievement at the time . Think of it . The number of people who saw that presentation in 1914 alone was greater than the total number of Kingdom publishers active in the world today ! Reports further indicate that in 1916 a total of 809 ,393 attended public meetings in the United States , and in 1918 the number rose to 949 ,444 . Those Bible Students were zealous !

And he urged him to go up against Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad . 3 Then King Aʹhab of Israel said to King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah : “ Will you go with me to Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad ? ” He replied to him : “ I am the same as you , and my people are the same as your people and will support you in the war . ”
“ I don ’ t think the counsel was appropriate . ” We may feel that the counsel does not really fit our circumstances or that the one giving it did not grasp the whole picture . Our immediate reaction might even be to belittle the counsel . ( Hebrews 12 :5 ) Since we are all imperfect , is it not possible that our own view of the matter is what needs adjusting ? ( Proverbs 19 :3 ) Was there not some valid reason for the counsel to be given ? Then that is what we need to focus on . God ’ s Word advises us : “ Hold on to discipline ; do not let it go . Safeguard it , for it means your life . ” —Proverbs 4 :13 .

In an environment where corruption is common , however , a Christian needs to be on guard so that the boundary between what is acceptable and what is unacceptable from God ’ s standpoint does not become blurred for him . It is one thing to give a tip in order to obtain what one is legally entitled to , yet quite another to seek an illegal favor . In an atmosphere of corruption , some people tip an official in order to obtain a service to which they are not entitled or offer a policeman or a government inspector a “ tip ” in order to avoid a proper and justifiable fine . Of course , it would be wrong to seek to corrupt anyone with a “ gift , ” just as it would also be wrong to be corrupted by accepting such a “ gift . ” Either action would distort justice .—Ex . 23 :8 ; Deut . 16 :19 ; Prov . 17 :23 .
17 While going up to Jerusalem , Jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the road : 18 “ Look ! We are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes . They will condemn him to death 19 and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake ; and on the third day he will be raised up . ”
When the school was inaugurated in congregations of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses in 1943 , its purpose was stated in these words : “ To prepare all ‘ faithful men , ’ those who have heard God ’ s Word and proved their faith therein , to ‘ be able to teach others ’ . . . to the one end of making each one . . . better equipped to publicly present the hope that is within him . ” ( Course in Theocratic Ministry , p . 4 ) The school ’ s objective has remained the same to this day .

27 After they took what Miʹcah had made , as well as his priest , they went to Laʹish , to a people quiet and unsuspecting . They struck them down with the sword and burned the city with fire . 28 There was no one to rescue it , for it was far from Siʹdon and they had no dealings with anyone else and it was in the valley plain that belonged to Beth-reʹhob . Then they rebuilt the city and settled in it . 29 Furthermore , they named the city Dan after the name of their father , Dan , who was born to Israel . But Laʹish was the city ’ s former name . 30 After that the Danʹites set up the carved image for themselves , and Jonʹa·than the son of Gerʹshom , the son of Moses , and his sons became priests to the tribe of the Danʹites until the day that the inhabitants of the land went into exile . 31 And they set up the carved image that Miʹcah had made , and it remained there all the days that the house of the true God was in Shiʹloh .

40 The dwelling of the Israelites , who had dwelled in Egypt , was 430 years . 41 At the end of the 430 years , on this very day , all the multitudes of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt . 42 It is a night on which they will celebrate Jehovah ’ s bringing them out of the land of Egypt . This night is to be observed to Jehovah by all the people of Israel throughout their generations .

15 Three of the 30 headmen went down to the rock , to David at the cave of A·dulʹlam , while a Phi·lisʹtine army was camped in the Valley of Rephʹa·im . 16 David was then in the stronghold , and a garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines was in Bethʹle·hem . 17 Then David expressed his longing : “ If only I could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of Bethʹle·hem ! ” 18 At that the three forced their way into the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of Bethʹle·hem and brought it to David ; but David refused to drink it and poured it out to Jehovah . 19 He said : “ It is unthinkable on my part from the standpoint of my God to do this ! Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives ? For it was at the risk of their lives that they brought it . ” So he refused to drink it . These are the things that his three mighty warriors did .

Imagine the effect this has on the disciples ! They have just seen the sea go from a raging storm to complete calm . An unusual fear grips them . They say to one another : “ Who really is this ?

During the Christmas season , a Christian ’ s employer may offer a present or a bonus . Should the Christian reject such ? Not necessarily . The employer may not even be thinking that by accepting the bonus the receiver is celebrating Christmas . The employer may simply be giving all his workers a share of the company ’ s profits . Or the bonus may be evidence of his gratitude for services rendered all year long as well as a stimulus to continued good work . The employer may give a gift to all employees—Jews , Muslims , or others—regardless of whether they celebrate Christmas or not . So the mere timing of the gift or the name that may be associated with it does not necessarily rule out its acceptance by one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses .

17 There was a man of the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im named Miʹcah . 2 He said to his mother : “ The 1 ,100 silver pieces that were taken from you about which you pronounced a curse , which I heard—look ! the silver is with me . I was the one who took it . ” At that his mother said : “ May Jehovah bless my son . ” 3 So he gave the 1 ,100 pieces of silver back to his mother , but his mother said : “ I will without fail sanctify the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son to use in making a carved image and a metal statue . Now I give it back to you . ”

If we have accomplished something worthwhile , could it be that Jehovah is ‘ leaving us alone to put us to the test , ’ allowing what is in our heart to surface ? For example , a brother may have worked hard to prepare a talk and give it before a large audience . Many praise him for what he has done . How will he react to the praise ? When praised , we do well to apply Jesus ’ words : “ When you have done all the things assigned to you , say : ‘ We are good-for-nothing slaves . What we have done is what we ought to have done . ’ ” ( Luke 17 :10 ) We can learn from Hezekiah ’ s experience . A haughty attitude surfaced in that he “ did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him . ” ( 2 Chron . 32 :24-27 , 31 ) Our meditating on how much God has done for us will help us to avoid an attitude that Jehovah hates . We can speak appreciatively of Jehovah who loyally supports his people . w17 .03 4 :12-14
PARENTS love to see their newborn baby smile . They often put their faces close to that of the infant , cooing and smiling expressively . They are eager to see a response . And before long , it comes—the baby ’ s cheeks dimple , the lips curl , and a delightful smile appears . In its own small way , that smile seems to express affection , the dawning love of the baby in response to the love of the parents .

14 Good judgment is needed to discern how to handle each situation . If a holiday greeting is casually extended , you could simply thank the well-wisher . But suppose you are dealing with someone you see or work with regularly . In that case , you might choose to say more . In all cases , be tactful . The Bible advises : “ Let your words always be gracious , seasoned with salt , so that you will know how you should answer each person . ” ( Colossians 4 :6 ) Be careful not to show disrespect for others . Instead , tactfully explain your position . Make clear that you are not against gift-giving and gatherings but prefer to participate in these activities at a different time .

No work is to be done on these days . Only what every person needs to eat , that alone may be prepared for you .

13 Being willing to lay down our life for our brothers is not the only way to show self-sacrificing love . After all , few of us are ever called upon to make such a great sacrifice . However , if we love our brothers enough to die for them , should we not be willing to make smaller sacrifices , going out of our way to help them now ? To be self-sacrificing means to give up our own advantage or comfort for the benefit of others . We put their needs and welfare ahead of our own even if it is not convenient . ( 1 Corinthians 10 :24 ) In what practical ways can we show self-sacrificing love ?
6 Another reason to be careful with our speech is that we are all imperfect . “ The inclination of the heart of man is bad , ” and our words often reveal what is in our heart . ( Genesis 8 :21 ; Luke 6 :45 ) It can be a real struggle to control what we say . ( Read James 3 :2-4 . ) But we need to keep trying to improve how we speak to others .
About a year after Nellie died , I received a wonderful blessing . I was invited to visit the branch office in Tallinn , Estonia .

3 In the 8th year of his reign , while he was still a boy , he started to search for the God of David his forefather ; and in the 12th year , he started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places and the sacred poles , the graven images , and the metal statues . 4 Further , they tore down the altars of the Baʹals in his presence , and he cut down the incense stands that were up above them . He also broke into pieces the sacred poles , the graven images , and the metal statues and reduced them to powder and sprinkled it over the graves of those who used to sacrifice to them . 5 And he burned the bones of priests on their altars . Thus he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem .
14 Christian parents have a responsibility to teach their families to apply Bible principles . This includes making sure that they and their children strive to make God ’ s heart rejoice by their modest style of dress and grooming . ( Prov . 22 :6 ; 27 :11 ) Parents can instill in their children a healthy respect for the holy God whom they worship by setting the right example for their children and by giving loving and practical instruction . How good it is when parents teach their youngsters where and how to find suitable clothes ! This means not just what they like but also what will enable them to carry out their privilege of representing Jehovah God .

All of us would do well to ponder that counsel , but especially should young people do so . One young man rented a video that he knew featured sexually stimulating scenes . He later related that after viewing the video , he felt so aroused that he sought out a prostitute , whom he knew to be living nearby . He ended up with a heavy heart , a guilty conscience , and anxiety over possible disease . What occurred was exactly as described in the Bible : “ All of a sudden he is going after her , like a bull that comes even to the slaughter . ” If only he had considered the “ end afterward ” ! —Proverbs 7 :22 , 23 .
14 Another way to keep your love for Jehovah burning brightly is to pray regularly . ( 1 Thessalonians 5 :17 ) In Chapter 17 of this book , we learned that prayer is a precious gift from God . Just as human relationships thrive on regular , open communication , so our relationship with Jehovah stays warm and alive when we pray to him regularly . It is vital that we never let our prayers become mechanical—mere routine words that we repeat over and over without real feeling or meaning . We need to speak to Jehovah as a child would talk to a beloved father . We want to speak with respect , of course , but openly , honestly , and from the heart . ( Psalm 62 :8 ) Yes , personal Bible study and heartfelt prayer are vital aspects of our worship , and they help us to remain in God ’ s love .

8 “ Love is long-suffering . ” Being long-suffering means patiently putting up with others . ( Colossians 3 :13 ) Do we not need such patience ? Because we are imperfect creatures serving shoulder to shoulder , it is only realistic to expect that from time to time , our Christian brothers may irritate us and we may do the same to them . But patience and forbearance can help us to cope with the minor scrapes and scratches we sustain in our dealings with others—without disrupting the peace of the congregation .

14 Instead of having one brother serve as the congregation overseer in each congregation , other brothers who were Scripturally qualified would now also be theocratically appointed to serve as Christian elders . Together they would form a body of elders that would oversee the local congregation . That new elder arrangement went into effect on October 1 , 1972 . Today the coordinator of a body of elders views himself , not as a first among equals , but “ as a lesser one . ” ( Luke 9 :48 ) What a blessing such humble brothers are for the worldwide brotherhood ! —Phil . 2 :3 .

He will bring mighty ones to ruin , also the people made up of the holy ones . 25 And by his cunning he will use deception to succeed ; and in his heart he will exalt himself ; and during a time of security he will bring many to ruin . He will even stand up against the Prince of princes , but he will be broken without human hand .

15 Construction of a house may be completed , yet work goes on . Maintenance and repairs are essential , and additions may be necessary as circumstances change . What do we need in order to mature and to maintain our spirituality ? Above all , love . We need to keep growing in love for Jehovah and for our fellow believers . If we do not have love , all our knowledge and works would amount to nothing—like a lot of empty noise . ( 1 Corinthians 13 :1-3 ) With love , we can attain Christian maturity and continue growing spiritually .

Then the boundary went back to Hoʹsah , and it ended at the sea in the region of Achʹzib , 30 Umʹmah , Aʹphek , and Reʹhob—22 cities and their settlements . 31 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Ashʹer by their families .

17 Can Jehovah repair all the damage that has been caused by the rebellion of Satan and humans ? Yes . With God , all things are possible . Jehovah knows when all of Satan ’ s challenges will have been fully answered . Then he will make the earth into a paradise , as it was meant to be . All those in “ the memorial tombs ” will be resurrected . ( John 5 :28 , 29 ) People will never get sick or die . Jesus will undo all the damage that Satan has caused . Jehovah will use Jesus “ to break up the works of the Devil . ” ( 1 John 3 :8 ) We are grateful that in the meantime Jehovah has been patient with us so that we can come to know him and can decide that we want him to be our Ruler . ( Read 2 Peter 3 :9 , 10 . ) Even when we suffer , he helps us to endure .—John 4 :23 ; read 1 Corinthians 10 :13 .

And was counted among the transgressors ;
These angelic sons of God had relations with women , and the women bore children who grew to possess extraordinary strength . They came to be known by the Hebrew term “ Nephilim . ” We are told : “ The Nephilim proved to be in the earth in those days , and also after that , when the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men and they bore sons to them , they were the mighty ones who were of old , the men of fame . ” ( Genesis 6 :4 ) The Nephilim were much to be feared . The word “ Nephilim ” means “ Fellers , ” those who cause others to fall down . They were killers whose violent exploits are likely echoed in ancient myths and legends .
14 The Bible warns us about a very strong form of abusive speech—reviling . Reviling is constantly insulting others with the intention of hurting them . How sad it would be if someone treated his mate or children in that way ! In fact , a person who refused to stop reviling others would no longer qualify to be part of the congregation . ( 1 Corinthians 5 :11-13 ; 6 :9 , 10 ) As we have learned , if we say things that are obscene , untrue , or unkind , we will harm our relationship with Jehovah and with others .

15 We live in exciting times . The earthly part of Jehovah ’ s organization is growing in many ways , but growth necessitates change . As changes affect us personally , may we be humble , keeping an eye on Jehovah ’ s interests and not on our own . Doing so promotes unity . To Christians in Rome , Paul wrote : “ I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think , but to think so as to have a sound mind , each one as God has given to him a measure of faith . For just as we have in one body many members , but the members do not all have the same function , so we , although many , are one body in union with Christ . ” —Rom . 12 :3-5 .

In the days of the prophets Ezekiel and Jeremiah in the seventh century B .C .E . , many Israelites ignored God ’ s Law and cultivated intimate association with people of the surrounding nations . By following their customs and participating in their festivals , the Israelites were practicing a mixed religion . Many of the Israelites were saying : “ Let us become like the nations , like the families of the lands , in ministering to wood and stone . ” ( Ezekiel 20 :32 ; Jeremiah 2 :28 ) They professed to worship Jehovah God , but at the same time , they venerated “ dungy idols , ” even sacrificing their sons to them .—Ezekiel 23 :37-39 ; Jeremiah 19 :3-5 .

On the contrary , Jesus expands his preaching activity by setting out “ on a tour of all the cities and villages [ of Galilee ] , teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity . ” ( Matthew 9 :35 ) What he sees convinces him of the need to expand the preaching work .

10 Have you ever tried to remove a stain from a light-colored garment ? Perhaps despite your best efforts , the stain remained visible . Notice how Jehovah describes his capacity for forgiveness : “ Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow ; though they should be red like crimson cloth , they will become even like wool . ” ( Isaiah 1 :18 ) The word “ scarlet ” denotes a bright red color . “ Crimson ” was one of the deep colors of dyed material . ( Nahum 2 :3 ) We can never through our own efforts remove the stain of sin . But Jehovah can take sins that are like scarlet and crimson and make them white like snow or undyed wool . When Jehovah forgives our sins , we need not feel that we bear the stain of such sins for the rest of our life .

We very much enjoyed rearing our daughters and always tried to do things as a family . Since we lived near Aspen , Colorado , we all took up skiing so that we could occasionally ski together .

Though young , they asked such questions as “ What will I do when I grow up ? ” and “ What kind of marriage mate do I want ? ” We endeavored to instill spiritual values in our daughters ’ minds and hearts . We kept before them the goal of the full-time ministry and the wisdom of marrying only someone with a similar goal . We tried to help them appreciate that it is best not to marry too young . We coined the phrase “ Stay free until you are at least 23 . ”

20 Jeʹhu continued : “ Declare a solemn assembly for Baʹal . ” So they proclaimed it . 21 After that Jeʹhu sent word throughout Israel , and all the worshippers of Baʹal came . Not a single one was left out who did not come . They entered the house of Baʹal , and the house of Baʹal was filled from end to end . 22 He said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe : “ Bring out garments for all the worshippers of Baʹal . ” So he brought out the clothing for them . 23 Then Jeʹhu and Je·honʹa·dab the son of Reʹchab went into the house of Baʹal . He now said to the worshippers of Baʹal : “ Search carefully and see that there are no worshippers of Jehovah here , only worshippers of Baʹal . ” 24 Finally they came in to offer up sacrifices and burnt offerings . Jeʹhu had stationed 80 of his men outside and said : “ If any one of the men I am putting into your hands escapes , it will be your life for his . ”

Preaching the Kingdom Message Abroad
19 Jesus was not exaggerating when he said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends . ” ( John 15 :13 ) His willingness to surrender his soul in our behalf was the greatest expression of his love for us . Yet , someone else has shown us even greater love . Jesus explained : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son , in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ” ( John 3 :16 ) God loves us so much that he gave his Son as a ransom , making it possible for us to be delivered from sin and death . ( Ephesians 1 :7 ) The ransom is a precious gift from Jehovah , but he does not force us to accept it .

As they were eating a meal together in Mizʹpah , 2 Ishʹma·el the son of Neth·a·niʹah and the ten men who were with him rose up and struck down Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam the son of Shaʹphan with the sword . So he put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land . 3 Ishʹma·el also struck down all the Jews who were with Ged·a·liʹah in Mizʹpah , as well as the Chal·deʹan soldiers who were there .

14 The Bible does not spell out in detail what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to secular work . This does not mean that we can accept just any kind of employment no matter what it involves . The Scriptures can help us to choose productive , honest work that is pleasing to God while avoiding employment that would be displeasing to him . ( Proverbs 2 :6 ) When facing decisions about employment , there are two key questions for us to consider .

21 Likewise today , many servants of God demonstrate that they “ hate what is bad , and love what is good . ” ( Amos 5 :15 ) A young brother in an African land recalls that a female classmate boldly offered him sex in exchange for his help during a mathematics test . “ I immediately rejected her offer , ” he says . “ By maintaining integrity , I have kept my dignity and self-respect , which are far more valuable than gold and silver . ” True , sin may give “ temporary enjoyment , ” but such cheap thrills often bring much pain . ( Hebrews 11 :25 ) Moreover , they pale into insignificance when compared with the lasting happiness that results from obedience to Jehovah .—Proverbs 10 :22 .

Soon after speaking about forgiveness at the home of the Pharisee Simon , Jesus begins another preaching tour of Galilee . He is in the second year of his ministry , and he is not traveling alone . The 12 apostles are with him , as well as certain women whom he had “ cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses . ” ( Luke 8 :2 ) Among them are Mary Magdalene , Susanna , and Joanna , whose husband is an officer of King Herod Antipas .
Sometimes it is difficult to see where a path is taking us . How thankful we are , therefore , for God ’ s loving concern and clear direction ! “ This is the way , ” Jehovah has said , “ walk in it , you people . ” ( Isaiah 30 :21 ) What is at the end of the path that Jehovah is showing us ? Though the path is narrow and difficult , Jesus said that it leads to life everlasting .—Matthew 7 :14 .
( CHORUS )
Jesus repeatedly employed this teaching device . He contrasted the popular understanding of the Mosaic Law with the true intent of the Law . ( Matt . 5 :21-48 ) He differentiated true godly devotion from the hypocritical acts of the Pharisees . ( Matt . 6 :1-18 ) He contrasted the spirit of those who ‘ lorded it over ’ others with the self-sacrificing spirit that his followers would show . ( Matt . 20 :25-28 ) On another occasion , recorded at Matthew 21 :28-32 , Jesus invited his listeners to draw their own contrast between self-righteousness and true repentance . That leads us to another valuable facet of good teaching .
2 While we may witness baptisms a few times a year in our locality , the angels are privileged to observe them much more often . Can you imagine how much “ joy in heaven ” there must be as they see thousands of individuals worldwide added to the visible part of Jehovah ’ s organization each week ? ( Luke 15 :7 , 10 ) No doubt , the angels are thrilled to observe this increase ! —Haggai 2 :7 .

1 Jude , a slave of Jesus Christ , but a brother of James , to the called ones who are loved by God the Father and preserved for Jesus Christ :
Still in Jerusalem for the Festival of Tabernacles ( or , Booths ) , Jesus goes on teaching vital truths . Some Jews present had just said to him : “ We are Abraham ’ s offspring and never have been slaves . ” Jesus responds : “ I know that you are Abraham ’ s offspring . But you are seeking to kill me , because my word makes no progress among you . I speak the things I have seen while with my Father , but you do the things you have heard from your father . ” —John 8 :33 , 37 , 38 .
6 “ But as I was traveling and getting near to Damascus , about midday , suddenly out of heaven a great light flashed all around me , 7 and I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me : ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ’ 8 I answered : ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And he said to me : ‘ I am Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ , whom you are persecuting . ’ 9 Now the men who were with me did see the light , but they did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me . 10 At that I said : ‘ What should I do , Lord ? ’ The Lord said to me : ‘ Rise , go into Damascus , and there you will be told about everything it is appointed for you to do . ’ 11 But since I could not see anything because of the glory of that light , I arrived in Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me .

In addition , Boaz did not speak down to the poor foreign woman but , instead , reassured her .—Ruth 2 :8-10 , 13 , 14 .
As Brother Harteva focused his attention on the new association and the new magazine , another brother began to serve as editor of the Finnish Watch Tower .

At that point , Brother Russell , out of concern for their spiritual welfare , appealed to Brother Harteva and others to “ return to the truth . ”

10 King David once experienced a severe sickness , which is mentioned in Psalm 41 . Confined for a time to a sickbed , David was so ill that it seemed to some of his enemies that he would never “ get up again . ” ( Verses 7 , 8 ) When was David stricken with such a serious illness ? The circumstances mentioned in this psalm may relate to the stressful time of David ’ s life when his son Absalom was trying to usurp the throne .—2 Sam . 15 :6 , 13 , 14 .
It is not easy to control our emotions when we feel that we have been slighted or treated unjustly . It can be devastating if we are mistreated because of our ethnic background , the color of our skin , or some other physical difference . How much greater the pain is if it is caused by a fellow Christian ! How wise it is to apply the Bible ’ s counsel to control our temper and avoid being quick to take offense ! ( Prov . 16 :32 ) No doubt all of us need to work at being less sensitive and more forgiving . Jehovah and Jesus take forgiveness very seriously . ( Matt . 6 :14 , 15 ) Do you need to be more forgiving or to give attention to controlling your emotions ? People who fail to control their emotions often become bitter . As a result , others may not want to be around them . A bitter individual can exert a bad influence in the congregation .—Lev . 19 :17 , 18 . w16 .11 3 :4-6

3 Remember that man was created “ in God ’ s image ” and likeness . ( Genesis 1 :26 , 27 ) Hence , we too have power—at least a measure of it . Our power may include the capacity to accomplish things , to work ; the possession of control or authority over others ; the ability to influence others , particularly those who love us ; physical strength ( might ) ; or material resources . Concerning Jehovah , the psalmist said : “ With you is the source of life . ” ( Psalm 36 :9 ) Therefore , directly or indirectly , God is the source of any legitimate power we might have . We therefore want to use it in ways that please him . How can we do so ?
When faced with decisions , big or small , call to mind those vital truths , and let them influence your thinking . Do not forget . Look to Jehovah for guidance . Instead of viewing matters simply from a fleshly standpoint or trusting the impulse of an imperfect heart , ask yourself , ‘ What counsel or principles from God ’ s Word should have a bearing on my decision ? ’ ( Prov . 3 :5-7 ; 28 :26 ) You can not recall things that you have never read or heard . But as you grow in accurate knowledge and love for Jehovah , the reservoir of knowledge that God ’ s spirit can help you to remember will expand , and your growing love for Jehovah will motivate you to act in harmony with it .

Do you have confidence that you will ? Romans chapter 8 offers advice that will help you to do so .

Nobody will stand up to you , until you have exterminated them . 25 You should burn the graven images of their gods in the fire . Do not desire the silver and the gold on them or take it for yourself , so that you are not ensnared by it , for it is something detestable to Jehovah your God . 26 You must not bring a detestable thing into your house and thereby become something devoted to destruction like it . You should utterly loathe it and absolutely detest it , because it is something devoted to destruction .

14 Malachi 3 :1-3 describes the time—from 1914 to early 1919—when the anointed “ sons of Levi ” would undergo a period of refinement . ( Read . ) During that time , Jehovah God , “ the true Lord , ” accompanied by Jesus Christ , “ the messenger of the covenant , ” came to the spiritual temple to inspect those serving there . After receiving needed discipline , Jehovah ’ s cleansed people were ready to take up a further assignment of service . In 1919 , a “ faithful and discreet slave ” was appointed to provide spiritual food to the household of faith . ( Matt . 24 :45 ) God ’ s people were now free of the influence of Babylon the Great . Since that time , by Jehovah ’ s undeserved kindness , his people have constantly been growing in knowledge of God ’ s will and in love for their heavenly Father . How grateful they are for his blessing ! [ 1 ]

Drawing on the example of a boxer of ancient times , Paul said of himself : “ The way I am aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air . ” ( 1 Cor . 9 :26 ) Just as a boxer fights off his opponent , we must fend off our enemies . Jehovah trains us and helps us in our fight . He provides lifesaving instructions in his Word . He also helps us through our Bible-based publications , Christian meetings , assemblies , and conventions . Are you putting into practice what you are learning ? If you failed to do so , it would be like “ striking the air , ” not fully opposing your enemy .

15 There may be occasions when it would be good for us to reconsider a choice or decision . It could be when the prevailing circumstances change . Jehovah altered his decision at times when circumstances changed . ( 1 Ki . 21 :20 , 21 , 27-29 ; 2 Ki . 20 :1-5 ) Or new information may provide us with a valid reason to adjust a decision . King David was given faulty information about Saul ’ s grandson Mephibosheth . When David later received accurate information , he amended his decision . ( 2 Sam . 16 :3 , 4 ; 19 :24-29 ) At times , it may be wise for us to do similarly .

When Paul wrote his second inspired letter to the congregation in Corinth , he emphasized the proper attitude to have toward giving . “ Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart , ” said Paul , “ not grudgingly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver . ” ( 2 Cor . 9 :7 ) Next , Paul mentioned those who benefit from generous giving : the recipients , whose needs are satisfied ; and the donors , who are enriched by spiritual blessings .—2 Cor . 9 :11-14 .

Nevertheless , when the Son of man arrives , will he really find this faith on the earth ? ”

If you are observant , you too can discern what people may be thinking about . Does the person look happy or sad ? Is he elderly , possibly infirm ? Do you see evidence that there are children in the home ? Does it seem that the person is materially well-off or that he struggles to obtain the necessities of life ? Do home decorations or personal jewelry indicate a religious influence ? If your greeting takes such things into account , the person may view you as someone who shares an interest in common with him .

17 After evening had fallen , he came with the Twelve . 18 And as they were reclining at the table and eating , Jesus said : “ Truly I say to you , one of you who is eating with me will betray me . ” 19 They began to be grieved and to say to him one by one : “ It is not I , is it ? ” 20 He said to them : “ It is one of the Twelve , the one dipping with me into the bowl . 21 For the Son of man is going away , just as it is written about him , but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed ! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born . ”
5 Get to know your children well—their thinking , their feelings , their concerns .

6 So he overtook them and spoke these words to them . 7 But they said to him : “ Why does my lord say such a thing ? It is unthinkable that your servants would do anything like this . 8 Why , the money that we found in the mouth of our bags we brought back to you from the land of Caʹnaan . How , then , could we steal silver or gold from the house of your master ? 9 If it is found with one of your slaves , let him die , and the rest of us will also become slaves to my master . ” 10 So he said : “ Let it be as you say : The one with whom it is found will become my slave , but the rest of you will be innocent . ” 11 With that each one quickly lowered his bag to the ground and opened it . 12 He searched carefully , starting with the oldest and finishing with the youngest . Finally the cup was found in Benjamin ’ s bag .

23 After he went into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said : “ By what authority do you do these things ? And who gave you this authority ? ” 24 In reply Jesus said to them : “ I will also ask you one thing . If you tell me , then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things : 25 The baptism by John , from what source was it ? From heaven or from men ? ” But they began to reason among themselves , saying : “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Why , then , did you not believe him ? ’ 26 But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we have the crowd to fear , for they all regard John as a prophet . ” 27 So they answered Jesus : “ We do not know . ” He , in turn , said to them : “ Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things .

36 Now there was a prophetess , Anna the daughter of Phanʹu·el , of Ashʹer ’ s tribe . This woman was well along in years and had lived with her husband for seven years after they were married , 37 and she was a widow now 84 years old . She was never missing from the temple , rendering sacred service night and day with fasting and supplications . 38 In that very hour she came near and began giving thanks to God and speaking about the child to all who were waiting for Jerusalem ’ s deliverance .

His mother ’ s name was Je·co·liʹah of Jerusalem . 4 He continued to do what was right in Jehovah ’ s eyes , just as his father Am·a·ziʹah had done . 5 And he kept searching for God in the days of Zech·a·riʹah , who taught him to fear the true God . During the time he was searching for Jehovah , the true God made him prosper .

The account provides two examples of disrespect . For one thing , the Law specified which pieces of a sacrificial offering were to go to the priests to eat . ( Deut . 18 :3 ) But at the tabernacle , the wicked priests had set up a very different practice . They would have their attendants simply jab a great fork into the cauldron where the meat was boiling , taking whatever choice morsel came out ! For another thing , when people brought their sacrifices to be burned at the altar , the wicked priests would have an attendant bully the offerer , demanding the raw meat even before the fat of the sacrifice was offered to Jehovah .—Lev . 3 :3-5 ; 1 Sam . 2 :13-17 .

17 We need God ’ s spirit so that we can lead a life dedicated to him . Think of yourself as the skipper of a sailboat . Your goal is to serve Jehovah forever . Holy spirit is like the wind that you want to catch so as to arrive at your destination safe and sound . You do not want to be carried hither and thither by the spirit of Satan ’ s world . ( 1 Cor . 2 :12 ) You have to identify , as it were , the right wind and catch it . That is the holy spirit . Through God ’ s Word and his spirit-directed organization , holy spirit will move you in the right direction .

Are you kind even when people are unkind to you ? If we want to imitate Jesus , we must be kind even to those who hate us . Jesus said : “ If you love those loving you , of what credit is it to you ? For even the sinners love those loving them . . . . To the contrary , continue to love your enemies . . . , and you will be sons of the Most High , because he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked . ” —Luke 6 :32-36 ; 10 :25-37 .

A son will bear no guilt because of the error of his father , and a father will bear no guilt because of the error of his son . The righteousness of the righteous one will be accounted to him alone , and the wickedness of the wicked one will be accounted to him alone .

25 Jehovah entrusts parents with the responsibility to raise their children according to his standards . ( Deut . 6 :6-8 ; Eph . 6 :4 ) That assignment is challenging , but it may become far more so in the event of a divorce . Views on parenting may differ sharply . For example , a Witness parent feels strongly that a child should be raised according to Christian standards , whereas a non-Witness parent may disagree . Of course , the Witness parent should respectfully recognize that while divorce may sever the marital relationship , the parental relationship remains intact .

13 Repentance must be followed by conversion , or ‘ turning around . ’ You must do more than feel regret . You need to reject your former way of life and be firmly determined that you will do what is right from now on . Repentance and conversion are steps that you must take before getting baptized .
Another way Satan tries to deceive us is by promoting an independent attitude . ( 2 Timothy 3 :4 ) If we are not careful , we could lose our respect for the authority of those appointed by Jehovah . For example , a brother might begin to resist the guidance of the congregation elders . ( Hebrews 12 :5 ) Or a sister might start to question Jehovah ’ s arrangement of headship in the family .—1 Corinthians 11 :3 .

IT IS about 46 C .E . , and Judea is in the grip of famine . The Jewish disciples of Christ living there lack the means to pay the sky-high prices demanded for the meager supply of grain available . They are hungry , staring starvation in the face . However , they are about to experience the protection of Jehovah ’ s hand in a way that no other disciples of Christ have ever felt it before . What is about to happen ?
32 So they came to a spot named Geth·semʹa·ne , and he said to his disciples : “ Sit down here while I pray . ” 33 And he took Peter and James and John along with him , and he began to feel deeply distressed and to be greatly troubled . 34 He said to them : “ I am deeply grieved , even to death . Stay here and keep on the watch . ” 35 And going a little way forward , he fell to the ground and began praying that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him . 36 And he said : “ Abba , Father , all things are possible for you ; remove this cup from me . Yet , not what I want , but what you want . ” 37 He returned and found them sleeping , and he said to Peter : “ Simon , are you sleeping ? Did you not have the strength to keep on the watch for one hour ? 38 Keep on the watch and pray continually , so that you do not come into temptation . The spirit , of course , is eager , but the flesh is weak . ” 39 And he went away again and prayed , saying the same thing . 40 And he came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were weighed down , so they did not know what to answer him . 41 And he returned the third time and said to them : “ At such a time as this , you are sleeping and resting ! It is enough ! The hour has come ! Look ! The Son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners . 42 Get up , let us go . Look ! My betrayer has drawn near . ”

What is the reaction of the people to what Jesus does ?
5 For they pay no attention to the activities of Jehovah ,
Why might our asking questions and listening carefully to answers move people to approach us ? —Matthew 16 :13-17 .
4 So they transported the Ark of the true God from A·binʹa·dab ’ s house on the hill , and A·hiʹo was walking ahead of the Ark . 5 David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before Jehovah with all sorts of juniper-wood instruments , harps , other stringed instruments , tambourines , sistrums , and cymbals . 6 But when they came to the threshing floor of Naʹcon , Uzʹzah thrust his hand out to the Ark of the true God and grabbed hold of it , for the cattle nearly upset it . 7 At that Jehovah ’ s anger blazed against Uzʹzah , and the true God struck him down there for his irreverent act , and he died there beside the Ark of the true God . 8 But David became angry because Jehovah ’ s wrath had broken through against Uzʹzah ; and that place has been called Peʹrez-uzʹzah down to this day . 9 So David became fearful of Jehovah on that day and said : “ How can the Ark of Jehovah come to me ? ” 10 David was not willing to bring the Ark of Jehovah to where he was in the City of David . Instead , David had it taken to the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom the Gitʹtite .

Everlasting life on a paradise earth ! By means of a study of the Bible , we learn about this wonderful hope . But this , as well as other basic teachings of God ’ s Word , is just a beginning . The Bible urges all who love God to “ grasp mentally . . . [ the ] height and depth ” of his precious truths . ( Ephesians 3 :18 ) To that end , this book has been prepared . We hope that it will help you to grow spiritually and to be better equipped to walk the narrow road leading to life in God ’ s righteous new world .

33 These were the stages of the journey of the people of Israel when they went out of the land of Egypt by their companies under the direction of Moses and Aaron . 2 Moses kept recording the departure places by the stages of their journey at the order of Jehovah , and these were their stages from one departure place to another : 3 They departed from Ramʹe·ses in the first month , on the 15th day of the month . On the very day after the Passover , the Israelites went out with confidence before the eyes of all the Egyptians . 4 Meanwhile , the Egyptians were burying all the firstborn whom Jehovah had struck down among them , for Jehovah had executed judgments on their gods .
May the name of the God of Jacob protect you .
8 Clearly , the counsel Jesus provided is as practical today as it was when it was given nearly 2 ,000 years ago . Is that not evidence of wisdom from above ? Even the best advice from human counselors tends to become outdated and is soon revised or replaced . The teachings of Jesus , however , have stood the test of time . But that should not surprise us , for this Wonderful Counselor spoke “ the sayings of God . ” —John 3 :34 .

18 God ’ s Kingdom rule will undo all the damage done to the human family for the past thousands of years . The joys at that time will far outweigh any suffering that we experience now . We will not be disturbed by any bad memories of previous suffering . The upbuilding thoughts and activities that will fill the everyday life of people in the new world will gradually erase the painful memories . Jehovah declares : “ I am creating new heavens [ a new heavenly Kingdom government over mankind ] and a new earth [ a righteous human society ] ; and the former things will not be called to mind , neither will they come up into the heart . But exult , you people , and be joyful forever in what I am creating . ” Yes , in Jehovah ’ s new world , righteous ones will be able to say : “ The whole earth has come to rest , has become free of disturbance . People have become cheerful with joyful cries . ” —Isaiah 14 :7 ; 65 :17 , 18 .
How did you meet your partner ?
5 If you do not have pressing family responsibilities , could you assist fellow worshippers who are caregivers and those who are infirm , elderly , or otherwise in need ? Why not look around in your congregation and take note of who needs help ? Perhaps you could spend time with the elderly parent of a Christian sister who is a caregiver while the sister attends to other matters . Or maybe you could help those who need assistance by offering to take them to meetings , to go shopping , to run errands , or to visit someone who is in the hospital . In doing so , you might be working with Jehovah to answer a prayer .—Read 1 Corinthians 10 :24 .
4 , 5 . What divine acts drew Joshua close to Jehovah ?
5 A second way to gain inner peace is by reading Bible texts and meditating on them . Why is this important ? The Bible contains practical spiritual guidance that can help you to avoid , reduce , or deal with anxiety . Do not overlook the fact that God ’ s Word is helpful and refreshing because it contains the Creator ’ s own words of wisdom . As you reflect on God ’ s thoughts—day or night—and consider how best to use the Bible ’ s practical guidance , you will be greatly strengthened . Jehovah specifically linked reading his Word with being “ courageous and strong ” and not being “ struck with terror or fear . ” —Josh . 1 :7-9 .

As time went by , new assignments prompted me to make more adjustments . In 1956 when Brother Nathan Knorr visited , I was assigned to care for public relations at the national convention . I had no experience , so others willingly helped me learn . Less than a year later , another national convention was arranged and Brother Frederick Franz from world headquarters visited . While serving as convention overseer , I learned from Brother Franz ’ s willingness to adjust to the people . The local brothers were pleased to see Brother Franz wearing the barong Tagalog , traditional Filipino attire , when giving the public talk .

11 When we contemplate the physical universe , we realize that Jehovah has great power . For example , the sun changes five million tons of its matter into energy every second . Although only a small amount passes through our globe ’ s atmosphere , it is enough to provide adequate heat and light to sustain life on earth . ( Ps . 74 :16 ; Isa . 40 :26 ) Jehovah is pleased to give an appropriate measure of power to his human servants when needed . ( Isa . 40 :29 ) Yes , God could even give us the strength to conquer every weakness without having to struggle with or learn from our mistakes . Why does he not do so ?
Isa 35 :4 Be s . Do not be afraid
He does not allow our feet to stumble .
With what will I bow before God on high ?

11 Jehovah has guaranteed that he will deliver his servants when he executes judgment upon the wicked . When sending the prophet Jeremiah to speak boldly to gross sinners , God said : “ Do not be afraid . ” Why not ? “ I am with you to deliver you . ” ( Jer . 1 :8 ) Similarly , when Jehovah was about to destroy wicked Sodom and Gomorrah , he sent two angels to escort Lot and his family safely out of the area . “ Then Jehovah made it rain sulphur and fire . . . upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah . ” —Gen . 19 :15 , 24 , 25 .

13 Some younger ones may now be coordinating activities that include older brothers . Though such younger ones have a changed role , they would do well to benefit from the wisdom and experience of older ones before making decisions . Paul , mentioned earlier , who replaced Peter as the overseer of a Bethel department , said , “ I took time to seek out the advice of Peter , and I encouraged others in the department to do the same . ”
It was not easy to make changes in my lifestyle . Leaving the gang was difficult . Some territories were marked , and I could not pass through them , although I no longer belonged to the gang .

32 “ Everyone , then , who acknowledges me before men , I will also acknowledge him before my Father who is in the heavens . 33 But whoever disowns me before men , I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens . 34 Do not think I came to bring peace to the earth ; I came to bring , not peace , but a sword . 35 For I came to cause division , with a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . 36 Indeed , a man ’ s enemies will be those of his own household . 37 Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me ; and whoever has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me . 38 And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me . 39 Whoever finds his soul will lose it , and whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it .

7 Jehovah then said to Moses : “ See , I have made you like God to Pharʹaoh , and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet . 2 You are to repeat everything that I will command you , and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharʹaoh , and he will send the Israelites away from his land . 3 As for me , I will allow Pharʹaoh ’ s heart to become obstinate , and I will multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt . 4 But Pharʹaoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my multitudes , my people , the Israelites , out of the land of Egypt with great judgments . 5 And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them . ” 6 Moses and Aaron did what Jehovah had commanded them ; they did just so . 7 Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 years old when they spoke to Pharʹaoh .
Having been exposed to a variety of circumstances in life , a person could be tempted to reason : ‘ I have faced this situation before . I know what to do . ’ Would this be the course of wisdom ? Proverbs 3 :7 cautions : “ Do not become wise in your own eyes . ” Experience should certainly broaden our view of factors to consider when dealing with situations in life . But if we are making spiritual progress , our experience should also impress on our minds and hearts that we need Jehovah ’ s blessing in order to succeed . Our advancement is manifest , then , not by our facing situations with confident self-assurance , but by our readily turning to Jehovah for direction in our lives . It is shown by our being confident that nothing can happen without his permission and by our maintaining a trusting and affectionate relationship with our heavenly Father .

Ezekiel was not involved in either the marking work or the destruction itself . Instead , the execution of judgment would be directed by the angels . So by means of this prophecy , we are allowed to see behind the scenes , as it were , into the heavenly realm itself . Jehovah had commissioned his angels not only to organize the destruction of the wicked but also to separate the righteous for survival .

21 In fact , to this course you were called , because even Christ suffered for you , leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely . 22 He committed no sin , nor was deception found in his mouth . 23 When he was being insulted , he did not insult in return . When he was suffering , he did not threaten , but he entrusted himself to the One who judges righteously . 24 He himself bore our sins in his own body on the stake , so that we might die to sins and live to righteousness . And “ by his wounds you were healed . ” 25 For you were like sheep going astray , but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls .

Bible translations in over one hundred different languages contain the divine name in the Christian Greek Scriptures . Many African , Native American , Asian , European , and Pacific-island languages use the divine name liberally . ( See the list on pages 1742 and 1743 . ) The translators of these editions decided to use the divine name for reasons similar to those stated above . Some of these translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures have appeared recently , such as the Rotuman Bible ( 1999 ) , which uses “ Jihova ” 51 times in 48 verses , and the Batak ( Toba ) version ( 1989 ) from Indonesia , which uses “ Jahowa ” 110 times .

For example , Hebrews 4 :12 is often quoted to show the power of God ’ s Word to touch hearts and influence lives . The context adds depth to our appreciation of how that can be so . It discusses the experiences of Israel during the 40 years in the wilderness before entering the land that Jehovah had promised to Abraham . ( Heb . 3 :7–4 :13 ) “ The word of God , ” his promise to bring them into a place of rest in harmony with his covenant with Abraham , was not dead ; it was alive and moving toward fulfillment . The Israelites had every reason to show faith in it . However , as Jehovah led them from Egypt to Mount Sinai and on toward the Promised Land , they repeatedly showed a lack of faith . Thus , by their reaction to the way that God carried out his word , what was in their hearts was made manifest . In a similar way in our day , God ’ s word of promise shows up what is in the hearts of men .

8 After the Rabʹsha·keh heard that the king of As·syrʹi·a had pulled away from Laʹchish , he returned to him and found him fighting against Libʹnah . 9 Now the king heard it said about King Tir·haʹkah of E·thi·oʹpi·a : “ Here he has come out to fight against you . ” So he sent messengers again to Hez·e·kiʹah , saying : 10 “ This is what you should say to King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah , ‘ Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying : “ Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As·syrʹi·a . ” 11 Look ! You have heard what the kings of As·syrʹi·a did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction . Will you alone be rescued ? 12 Did the gods of the nations that my forefathers destroyed rescue them ? Where are Goʹzan , Haʹran , Reʹzeph , and the people of Eʹden who were in Tel-asʹsar ? 13 Where is the king of Haʹmath , the king of Arʹpad , and the king of the cities of Seph·ar·vaʹim , and of Heʹna , and of Ivʹvah ? ’ ”
WHY is it a challenge to apply what we learn from God ’ s Word ? One reason is that it takes humility to do what is right , and our ability to remain humble is under assault . In these “ last days , ” we are surrounded by people who are “ lovers of themselves , lovers of money , boastful , haughty , ” and “ without self-control . ” ( 2 Tim . 3 :1-3 ) When selfish behavior is reported and even celebrated , a servant of God might despise such conduct but envy the results . ( Ps . 37 :1 ; 73 :3 ) One might even wonder : ‘ Is there any point in my putting others ’ interests ahead of my own ? If I conduct myself “ as a lesser one , ” might people lose respect for me ? ’ ( Luke 9 :48 ) Allowing the world ’ s selfish spirit to influence us could harm the loving relationships we enjoy in the congregation and our identity as Christians . But we are rewarded when we study the good examples set out in the Bible and imitate them .

7 As described in the Bible , love for God is much more than a feeling . In fact , although the feeling of love for Jehovah is essential , that feeling is just the beginning of real love for him . An apple seed is essential to the development of a fruit-bearing apple tree . If you wanted an apple , however , would you be content if someone merely handed you an apple seed ? Hardly ! Similarly , a feeling of love for Jehovah God is only a start . The Bible teaches : “ This is what the love of God means , that we observe his commandments ; and yet his commandments are not burdensome . ” ( 1 John 5 :3 ) To be genuine , love for God must bear fine fruit . It must be expressed in actions .—Read Matthew 7 :16-20 .

6 There is another tragedy that I have seen under the sun , and it is common among men : 2 The true God gives a man riches and material possessions and glory , so that he lacks nothing that he desires ; yet the true God does not enable him to enjoy them , although a stranger may enjoy them . This is futility and a severe affliction . 3 If a man should become a father a hundred times and live for many years and reach old age , yet he does not enjoy his good things before he reaches the grave , I must say that a stillborn child is better off than he is . 4 For this one came in vain and went away in darkness , and his name is shrouded in darkness . 5 Even though he never saw the sun or knew anything , he is still better off than the former one . 6 What is the benefit of living a thousand years twice over but not experiencing enjoyment ? Do not all go to the same place ?

And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy , God ’ s Son . 36 And look ! Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son , in her old age , and this is the sixth month for her , the so-called barren woman ; 37 for no declaration will be impossible for God . ” 38 Then Mary said : “ Look ! Jehovah ’ s slave girl ! May it happen to me according to your declaration . ” At that the angel departed from her .

12 A father and mother need to go on a trip . They can not take their children along , so they hire a babysitter . Their instructions to her are simple : “ Take care of our children . Feed them , make sure they are clean , and keep them from harm . ” When the parents return , though , they are shocked to see that their children are famished . They are dirty , sickly , and miserable . They are crying for the babysitter ’ s attention , but their cries go unheeded . Why ? She is up on a ladder , washing the windows . Furious , the parents demand an explanation . The sitter replies : “ Look at all that I did ! Aren ’ t the windows clean ? I made repairs to the house too , all for you ! ” Would the parents feel better ? Hardly ! They never asked her to do those jobs ; they just wanted their children cared for . Her refusal to heed their instructions would infuriate them .

15 What helped these brothers and sisters to make wise use of their freedom ? Consider John and Judith , who for the past 30 years have served in a number of countries . They recall that when the Pioneer Service School began in 1977 , the emphasis was placed on being willing to move and serve where the need was greater . To keep their focus on this goal , John says that he changed jobs many times in order to maintain a simple lifestyle . Eventually , when they arrived in a foreign country , they found that praying to Jehovah and relying on him helped them to overcome such obstacles as learning a new language , adjusting to a new culture , and enduring difficult climates . How did those years of service affect them ? “ I felt that I was immersed in the best activity I ’ ve ever known or experienced , ” John says . “ Jehovah became more real to me , as a loving father would be . Now I understood better what James 4 :8 means : ‘ Draw close to God , and he will draw close to you . ’ I knew I had found what I was looking for , a satisfying purpose in life . ”

7 However , what Paul wrote in chapter 7 gives us a clue as to the “ flesh ” spoken of at Romans 8 :4-13 . He linked “ living according to the flesh ” with “ the sinful passions ” that were then “ at work in [ their ] bodies . ” ( Rom . 7 :5 ) This sheds light on the meaning of the expression “ those who live according to the flesh , ” who Paul said , “ set their minds on the things of the flesh . ” He was referring to people who are ruled by or focused on their desires and leanings as imperfect humans . In the main , these are ones who follow their cravings , impulses , and passions , whether sexual or otherwise .

2 Moses then called together all Israel and said to them : “ You have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharʹaoh and all his servants and all his land , 3 the great judgments that your eyes saw , those great signs and miracles . 4 But Jehovah has not given you a heart to understand and eyes to see and ears to hear , down to this day . 5 ‘ While I kept guiding you for 40 years in the wilderness , your garments did not wear out on you and your sandals did not wear out on your feet . 6 You did not eat bread , and you did not drink wine or anything alcoholic , so that you would know that I am Jehovah your God . ’ 7 You eventually came to this place , and Siʹhon the king of Heshʹbon and Og the king of Baʹshan came out to meet us in battle , but we defeated them . 8 After that we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reuʹben·ites , the Gadʹites , and the half tribe of the Ma·nasʹsites . 9 Therefore , observe the words of this covenant and obey them , so that everything you do will turn out well .
5 Weighty personal decisions can have quite a bearing on our spiritual health and welfare . Every choice we make will likely affect our relationship with Jehovah—either for good or for bad . A good decision will strengthen our relationship with God , whereas a bad one may damage it . Moreover , a poor decision could injure others spiritually by disturbing , or even stumbling , them or by disrupting the unity of the congregation . Indeed , our personal decisions do matter .—Read Romans 14 :19 ; Galatians 6 :7 .

He understood that having God ’ s favor is far more important than having the approval of those who oppose Him . And Noah was favored by God .

Serving shoulder to shoulder with our brothers and sisters promotes unity . It also builds lasting friendships and increases mutual confidence in the coming blessings under God ’ s Kingdom . As we strengthen the hands of others , we help them to battle discouraging circumstances and to maintain a positive and hopeful view of the future . ( Isa . 35 :4 ) Moreover , doing that for others helps us to keep our spiritual focus and to feel the reality of what God has in store for us . Yes , it strengthens our hands too . Seeing how Jehovah on different occasions supported and protected his faithful servants in the past should build our faith and trust in him today . So when you face pressures and problems , “ do not let your hands drop down ” ! ( Zeph . 3 :16 ) Instead , reach out to Jehovah in prayer , and allow his mighty hand to strengthen you and lead you to Kingdom blessings .—Ps . 73 :23 , 24 . w16 .09 1 :16-18

So the house of Jehovah was completed .

He will give it to the owner on the day his guilt is proved . 6 And he will bring to the priest as his guilt offering to Jehovah a sound ram from the flock according to the assessed value , for a guilt offering . 7 The priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah , and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done resulting in his guilt . ”

20 Now in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware , and some for an honorable use but others for a use lacking honor . 21 So if anyone keeps clear of the latter ones , he will be an instrument for an honorable use , sanctified , useful to his owner , prepared for every good work . 22 So flee from youthful desires , but pursue righteousness , faith , love , peace , along with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart .
11 While the man was still holding on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them at what was called Solʹo·mon ’ s Colonnade , completely surprised . 12 When Peter saw this , he said to the people : “ Men of Israel , why are you so amazed at this , and why are you staring at us as though by personal power or godly devotion we have made him walk ? 13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob , the God of our forefathers , has glorified his Servant , Jesus , whom you handed over and disowned before Pilate , even though he had decided to release him . 14 Yes , you disowned that holy and righteous one , and you asked for a man who was a murderer to be given to you , 15 whereas you killed the Chief Agent of life . But God raised him up from the dead , of which fact we are witnesses . 16 And through his name , and by our faith in his name , this man whom you see and know has been made strong . The faith that is through him has made this man completely healthy in front of all of you . 17 And now , brothers , I know that you acted in ignorance , just as your rulers also did . 18 But in this way God has fulfilled the things he announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets , that his Christ would suffer .
And he does not allow any trouble against Israel .
One aspect of having inner peace is that we strive to be at peace with those in our family and those in the congregation . We have the good sense to realize that both we and our brothers and sisters are imperfect . Because of this , problems may occasionally arise , and if that happens , we have been taught to follow Jesus ’ advice : “ Make your peace with your brother . ” ( Matt . 5 :24 ) This is made easier when we recall that the other brother or sister is also serving “ the God who gives peace . ” ( Rom . 15 :33 ; 16 :20 ) And there is another peace that is of incalculable value . By our “ setting the mind on the spirit , ” we enjoy peace with our Maker . Isaiah recorded words that applied in his day but have an even greater fulfillment now : “ You [ Jehovah ] will safeguard those who fully lean on you ; you will give them continuous peace , because it is in you that they trust . ” —Isa . 26 :3 ; Rom . 5 :1 . w16 .12 2 :5 , 18 , 19

Research takes effort , but doing it will help you to find God ’ s thoughts on matters , to correct mistaken ideas , and to make firm your grasp of the truth . It will also add substance and life to your presentations , making them a pleasure to deliver and a delight to hear .

8 Then Boʹaz said to Ruth : “ Listen , my daughter . Do not go away to glean in another field , and do not go anywhere else ; stay close by my young women . 9 Keep your eyes on the field that they harvest , and go with them . I have commanded the young men not to touch you . When you are thirsty , go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn . ”
10 Secular work has a place in the life of true Christians . We want to find satisfaction and a measure of contentment in our work , but this can be a real challenge if we find ourselves working at a secular job that is not to our liking . How is it possible to find enjoyment for our work under such circumstances ?

At times , some Christians have decided to separate from their mate even though no immorality has taken place . ( 1 Corinthians 7 :11 ) In the following situations , a Christian may consider separation .
12 There is something else that you must do before you can get baptized . The apostle Peter said : “ Repent , therefore , and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out . ” ( Acts 3 :19 ) What does it mean to repent ? It means to feel very sorry for any wrong that we have done . For example , if you lived a sexually immoral life , then you would need to repent . And even if all your life you have tried your best to do what is right , you still need to repent , because we all sin and need to ask God for his forgiveness .—Romans 3 :23 ; 5 :12 .

11 Moreover , if two lie down together , they will stay warm , but how can just one keep warm ? 12 And someone may overpower one alone , but two together can take a stand against him . And a threefold cord can not quickly be torn apart .
So it was a massive effort .
38 When E·liʹsha returned to Gilʹgal , there was famine in the land . The sons of the prophets were sitting before him , and he said to his attendant : “ Put the large pot on and boil stew for the sons of the prophets . ” 39 So one of them went out to the field to pick mallows , and he found a wild vine and picked wild gourds from it , filling his garment . He then returned and sliced them into the stewpot , not knowing what they were . 40 They later served it to the men to eat , but as soon as they ate from the stew , they cried out : “ There is death in the pot , O man of the true God . ” And they could not eat it . 41 So he said : “ Bring some flour . ” After he threw it into the pot , he said : “ Serve it to the people . ” And nothing harmful was in the pot .
7 . Why did the preaching work anger the chief priests ?
7 So the king and Haʹman came in to Queen Esther ’ s banquet . 2 The king said to Esther again on the second day during the banquet of wine : “ What is your petition , Queen Esther ? It will be granted you . And what is your request ? Even to the half of my kingdom , it will be done ! ” 3 Queen Esther answered : “ If I have found favor with you , O king , and if it pleases the king , let my life be granted as my petition , and my people as my request . 4 For we have been sold , I and my people , to be annihilated , killed , and destroyed . If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves , I would have kept silent . But the distress is not proper , for it will be damaging to the king . ”

Samuel had an unusual childhood . Shortly after he was weaned , at perhaps four years of age or so , he began a life of service at the sacred tabernacle of Jehovah at Shiloh , over 20 miles [ 30 km ] from his home in Ramah . His parents , Elkanah and Hannah , dedicated their boy to Jehovah in a special form of service , making him a lifelong Nazirite . Did this mean that Samuel was cast off , unloved by his parents ?

11 How might we imitate Paul ’ s exemplary humility ? First , we must resist any temptation to expect or accept adulation for what we accomplish in Jehovah ’ s strength . Each of us does well to ask himself : ‘ How do I view the people to whom I preach ? Might I unwittingly harbor toward certain people a bias that is common in my community ? ’ Commendably , Jehovah ’ s Witnesses around the world have been analyzing their territories to determine whether there are yet more who might respond to the good news . At times , this may require learning the languages and customs of those whom society in general has marginalized . In no way should Witnesses who reach out to such ones view themselves as superior . Rather , they seek to understand each individual in order to reach his heart with the Kingdom message .
16 “ Love . . . does not brag , does not get puffed up . ” Love restrains us from flaunting our talents or accomplishments . If we truly love our brothers , how could we constantly brag about our success in the ministry or our privileges in the congregation ? Such boasting can tear others down , causing them to feel inferior in comparison . Love does not allow us to brag about what God lets us do in his service . ( 1 Corinthians 3 :5-9 ) After all , love “ does not get puffed up , ” or as The New Testament in Modern English says , it does not “ cherish inflated ideas of its own importance . ” Love prevents us from having an elevated view of ourselves .—Romans 12 :3 .
12 In a promise of restoration , the prophet Micah expressed his conviction that Jehovah would forgive his repentant people : “ Who is a God like you , . . . passing over transgression of the remnant of his inheritance ? . . . And you will throw into the depths of the sea all their sins . ” ( Micah 7 :18 , 19 ) Imagine what those words meant to those living in Bible times . Was there any chance of retrieving something that had been hurled “ into the depths of the sea ” ? Micah ’ s words thus indicate that when Jehovah forgives , he removes our sins permanently .

7 Jehovah ’ s purpose is for all intelligent creation to be united in true worship . How we long for the day when all who live will worship the only true God ! ( Psalm 103 :19-22 ) But before that can be , Jehovah must eliminate all who refuse to do his righteous will . Mercifully , he gives advance notice of what he will do , so that people everywhere can have the opportunity to change their course . ( Isaiah 55 :6 , 7 ) Thus , in our day “ to every nation and tribe and tongue and people , ” this urgent appeal is being made : “ Fear God and give him glory , because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived , and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters . ” ( Revelation 14 :6 , 7 ) Have you accepted that invitation ? If so , it is your privilege to invite yet others to know and worship the true God .

22 Later the Phi·lisʹtines came up once again and spread out in the Valley of Rephʹa·im . 23 David inquired of Jehovah , but He said : “ Do not go directly up . Instead , go around behind them , and come against them in front of the baʹca bushes . 24 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baʹca bushes , then act decisively , for Jehovah will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the Phi·lisʹtines . ” 25 So David did just as Jehovah commanded him , and he struck down the Phi·lisʹtines from Geʹba all the way to Geʹzer .

It is now late in the year 32 C .E . , about three years since Jesus ’ baptism . He and his disciples recently were at the Festival of Tabernacles in Jerusalem . They likely are still nearby . ( Luke 10 :38 ; John 11 :1 ) In fact , Jesus spends most of the remaining six months of his ministry in Judea or across the Jordan River in the district of Perea . Preaching is needed in these areas too .

35 When it became day , the civil magistrates sent the constables to say : “ Release those men . ” 36 The jailer reported their words to Paul : “ The civil magistrates have sent men to have you two released . So come out now and go in peace . ” 37 But Paul said to them : “ They flogged us publicly , uncondemned , though we are Romans , and threw us into prison . Are they now throwing us out secretly ? No , indeed ! Let them come themselves and escort us out . ” 38 The constables reported these words to the civil magistrates . These grew fearful when they heard that the men were Romans . 39 So they came and pleaded with them , and after escorting them out , they requested them to depart from the city . 40 But they came out of the prison and went to the home of Lydʹi·a ; and when they saw the brothers , they encouraged them and departed .

( Hebrews 11 :4-38 ) Yes , righthearted ones have refused to turn their backs on God .

It is no place for seed and figs and vines and pomegranates , and there is no water to drink . ” 6 Then Moses and Aaron came from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell with their faces to the ground , and Jehovah ’ s glory began to appear to them .

In turn the workers in the house of Jehovah used it to mend and repair the house . 11 They gave it to the craftsmen and the builders to buy hewn stones and timbers for braces and to build with beams the houses that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin .

5 Then the prophets Hagʹgai and Zech·a·riʹah the grandson of Idʹdo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem , in the name of the God of Israel who was over them . 2 It was then that Ze·rubʹba·bel the son of She·alʹti·el and Jeshʹu·a the son of Je·hozʹa·dak started to rebuild the house of God , which was in Jerusalem ; and the prophets of God were with them and supported them . 3 At that time Tatʹte·nai the governor of the region Beyond the River and Sheʹthar-bozʹe·nai and their colleagues came to them and asked them : “ Who issued an order to you to build this house and to finish this structure ? ” 4 Then they asked them : “ What are the names of the men who are working on this building ? ” 5 But God was watching over the elders of the Jews , and they did not stop them until the report could be sent to Da·riʹus and an official document could be sent back concerning this .

6 When it comes to freedom , a key point for us to bear in mind is that Jehovah God alone has what can be called absolute and unlimited freedom . Why ? Because he is the Creator of all things and the almighty Sovereign of the universe . ( 1 Tim . 1 :17 ; Rev . 4 :11 ) Recall the beautiful words of King David in describing the unique and lofty position that Jehovah alone occupies . ( Read 1 Chronicles 29 :11 , 12 . ) Accordingly , all creatures in heaven and on earth have freedom in only a relative sense . They must recognize that Jehovah God has the ultimate authority to impose what he determines to be just , necessary , and reasonable limits . That , in fact , was what Jehovah God did with his human creation right from the beginning .
16 What about faithful parents whose children have gone astray ? Elderly Samuel could not force his adult sons to remain loyal to the righteous standards he taught them . ( 1 Sam . 8 :1-3 ) He had to leave the matter in Jehovah ’ s hands . Even so , Samuel could maintain his own integrity and please his heavenly Father , Jehovah . ( Prov . 27 :11 ) Today , a number of Christian parents find themselves in a similar situation . They trust that like the father in the parable of the prodigal son , Jehovah is ever on the lookout to welcome back sinners who repent . ( Luke 15 :20 ) At the same time , such parents work hard to remain loyal to Jehovah , hoping that their example will move their children to return to the fold .
Quite a number of Bible translators have taken the unjustifiable liberty of omitting God ’ s name , Jehovah , from modern translations even though that name is found in ancient Bible manuscripts . ( See Appendix A4 . ) Many translations replace the name with a title , such as “ Lord , ” and some even obscure the fact that God has a name . For example , in some translations , Jesus ’ prayer recorded at John 17 :26 reads : “ I made you known to them , ” and at John 17 :6 , “ I have revealed you to those whom you gave me . ” However , a faithful rendering of Jesus ’ prayer reads : “ I have made your name known to them , ” and “ I have made your name manifest to the men whom you gave me . ”
To you the nations will come from the ends of the earth ,

6 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering , and the time for my releasing is imminent . 7 I have fought the fine fight , I have run the race to the finish , I have observed the faith . 8 From this time on , there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give me as a reward in that day , yet not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his manifestation .
13 We see that integrity enables us to take our stand for Jehovah ’ s sovereignty . It is thus the basis on which God can judge us . Job well understood this truth . ( Read Job 31 :6 . ) Job knew that God weighs all mankind in “ accurate scales , ” using His perfect standard of justice to gauge our integrity . David similarly said : “ Jehovah himself will pass sentence on the peoples . Judge me , O Jehovah , according to my righteousness and according to my integrity in me . . . . And God as righteous is testing out heart and kidneys . ” ( Ps . 7 :8 , 9 ) We know that God can look into the very depths of the inner person , the figurative “ heart and kidneys . ” We need to remember , though , what he is looking for . As David said , Jehovah judges us according to our integrity .

14 It is difficult to imagine the wonders that Jehovah has in store for anointed Christians when they are seated on thrones to rule with Christ in heaven . ( Luke 22 :28-30 ; Phil . 3 :20 , 21 ; 1 John 3 :2 ) Toward them in particular , Jehovah will “ demonstrate the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness . ” They will make up “ the New Jerusalem , ” the bride of Christ . ( Rev . 3 :12 ; 17 :14 ; 21 :2 , 9 , 10 ) They will share with Jesus in “ the healing of the nations , ” directing obedient humans to the means to become free from the burden of sin and death and raising them to perfection .—Read Revelation 22 :1 , 2 , 17 .

20 The men of Israel now went out to battle against Benjamin ; they drew up in battle formation against them at Gibʹe·ah . 21 So the Benʹja·min·ites came out from Gibʹe·ah and struck down 22 ,000 men of Israel on that day . 22 However , the army of the men of Israel showed themselves courageous and again drew up in battle formation in the same place as on the first day . 23 Then the Israelites went up and wept before Jehovah until the evening and inquired of Jehovah : “ Should we again go into battle against our brothers , the people of Benjamin ? ” To this Jehovah said : “ Go up against them . ”

2 We too have choices and decisions to make . Not every one of our decisions is a life-and-death matter . However , many of our decisions , the choices we make , can have a profound effect on us . Hence , the ability to make good decisions can help us to live a relatively smooth , peaceful life rather than one that is full of chaos , controversy , and disappointment .—Prov . 14 :8 .

6 That same day , Pharʹaoh commanded the taskmasters and their foremen : 7 “ You must no longer give straw to the people to make bricks . Let them go and gather straw for themselves . 8 But you must still impose on them the same quota of bricks as they made in the past . Do not reduce it for them , for they are relaxing . That is why they are crying out , ‘ We want to go , we want to sacrifice to our God ! ’ 9 Make them work harder , and keep them busy so that they will not pay attention to lies . ”
13 Jehovah now spoke to Moses , saying : 2 “ Send out men to spy out the land of Caʹnaan , which I am giving to the Israelites . You are to send out one man from each ancestral tribe , each one a chieftain among them . ”
5 Praise him with ringing cymbals .
“ YOU well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed . They have all come true for you . ” ( Joshua 23 :14-16 ) This is what Joshua said to the older men of Israel after they were settled in the Promised Land . Yes , Jehovah ’ s promises proved trustworthy . That record—and all the rest of the Bible—was preserved for us so that “ we might have hope . ” —Romans 15 :4 .
13 But you have said : ‘ What does God really know ?
15 We , though , who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong , and not to be pleasing ourselves . 2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good , to build him up . 3 For even the Christ did not please himself , but just as it is written : “ The reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me . ” 4 For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction , so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope . 5 Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant you to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had , 6 so that unitedly you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .

Jehovah helped the Israelites to defeat the Amalekites and the Ethiopians , and he gave Nehemiah and his associates the power to complete the rebuilding work . God will similarly give us strength to stand firm against opposition , apathy , and anxiety so that we can carry out our preaching work . ( 1 Pet . 5 :10 ) We do not expect Jehovah to perform miracles for us . Rather , we should do our part . That includes our reading God ’ s Word daily , preparing for and attending the meetings weekly , feeding our mind and heart through personal study and family worship , and always relying on Jehovah in prayer . Let us never allow other pursuits and activities to interfere with the means that Jehovah uses to strengthen and encourage us . If you sense that your hands have dropped down in any of these areas , ask for God ’ s help . Then see how his spirit “ energizes you , giving you both the desire and the power to act . ” w16 .09 1 :12

7 After that Jehovah said to Noah : “ Go into the ark , you and all your household , because you are the one I have found to be righteous before me among this generation . 2 You must take with you every kind of clean animal by sevens , the male and its mate ; and of every animal that is not clean just two , the male and its mate ; 3 also of the flying creatures of the sky by sevens , male and female , to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth . 4 For in just seven days , I will make it rain on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights , and I will wipe from the surface of the ground every living thing that I have made . ” 5 Then Noah did everything that Jehovah had commanded him .
CHAPTER 38
12 It is frustrating and exhausting ,
9 If we appreciate the hope of everlasting life made possible by Jesus ’ sacrifice , we will want to do the things that Jehovah has spoken to us through Jesus . These revolve around our love for God and for our neighbors . ( Matthew 22 :37-39 ) Jesus showed that our love for Jehovah would motivate us to teach others “ to observe all the things [ that Jesus has ] commanded [ us ] . ” ( Matthew 28 :19 , 20 ) And we want to share that love with fellow servants of Jehovah by the regular “ gathering of ourselves together ” with them . ( Hebrews 10 :25 ; Galatians 6 :10 ) Too , in listening to God and his Son , we should not think that they demand perfection from us . Hebrews 4 :15 says that Jesus , as our High Priest , can “ sympathize with our weaknesses . ” How comforting that is , especially when we approach God in prayer through Christ for help to overcome our weaknesses ! —Matthew 6 :12 .
2 “ But who will endure the day of his coming , and who will be able to stand when he appears ? For he will be like the fire of a refiner and like the lye of laundrymen . 3 And he will sit as a refiner and cleanser of silver and will cleanse the sons of Leʹvi ; and he will clarify them like gold and like silver , and they will certainly become to Jehovah people presenting a gift offering in righteousness . 4 And the gift offering of Judah and of Jerusalem will actually be pleasing to Jehovah , as in the days of long ago and as in the years of antiquity .
Love the God Who Loves You
12 As followers of Jesus , we need to love one another as he loved us . This means being willing to make sacrifices for fellow believers . How far must we be willing to go ? The Bible tells us : “ By this we have come to know love , because that one surrendered his soul for us ; and we are under obligation to surrender our souls for our brothers . ” ( 1 John 3 :16 ) Like Jesus , we must be willing to die for one another if necessary . In times of persecution , we would rather sacrifice our own life than betray our spiritual brothers and thus endanger their lives . In lands divided by racial or ethnic strife , we would risk our own lives to protect our brothers , regardless of their racial or ethnic background . When nations go to war , we would sooner face imprisonment or even death than take up weapons against fellow believers—or anyone else for that matter .—John 17 :14 , 16 ; 1 John 3 :10-12 .
, Pr 3 :27 good if it is within your p .
11 What can we pray for ? We can pray for anything that is acceptable to Jehovah . The Bible says : “ No matter what we ask according to his will , he hears us . ” ( 1 John 5 :14 ) Can we pray about personal things ? Yes . Praying to Jehovah should be like talking to a close friend . We can tell Jehovah anything that ’ s on our mind and in our heart . ( Psalm 62 :8 ) We can pray for him to give us his powerful holy spirit to help us do what ’ s right . ( Luke 11 :13 ) We can also ask Jehovah for wisdom to make good decisions , and we can pray for strength to cope with difficulties . ( James 1 :5 ) We should ask Jehovah to forgive our sins . ( Ephesians 1 :3 , 7 ) We should also pray for others , including our family and our brothers and sisters in the congregation .—Acts 12 :5 ; Colossians 4 :12 .
2 “ Before you I will go ,
5 Jehovah spoke to me again :
16 What good is it that the stupid one has the means to acquire wisdom
15 And truly , I will be with you , and will keep you wherever you go , guiding you back again to this land ; and I will not give you up till I have done what I have said to you .

2 In those days I , Daniel , had been mourning for three full weeks . 3 I ate no rich food , and no meat or wine entered my mouth , and I did not put any oil on myself for three full weeks . 4 On the 24th day of the first month , while I was on the bank of the great river , the Tiʹgris , 5 I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen , and around his waist was a belt of gold from Uʹphaz . 6 His body was like chrysʹo·lite , his face had the appearance of lightning , his eyes were like fiery torches , his arms and his feet looked like burnished copper , and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude . 7 Only I , Daniel , saw the vision ; the men with me did not see the vision . However , a great trembling seized them , and they ran away and hid .
And a new form of music was born .

‘ Keep On Seeking First the Kingdom ’
9 Before your cooking pots feel the heat of the bramble ,
11 He has forced me off the paths and torn me to pieces ;
5 Later on that final night , when Jesus went to the garden of Gethsemane with the 11 faithful apostles , his patience was tested yet again . Leaving eight of the apostles , Jesus took Peter , James , and John deeper into the garden . “ My soul is deeply grieved , even to death , ” Jesus told them . “ Stay here and keep on the watch . ” He went a short distance away and began praying fervently . After praying at length , he returned to the three apostles . What did he find ? In this , his hour of greatest trial , they were fast asleep ! Did he berate them for their lack of vigilance ? No , he patiently exhorted them . His kind words showed an understanding of the stress they had been under and of their weaknesses . “ The spirit , of course , is eager , ” he said , “ but the flesh is weak . ” Jesus remained patient that evening , even when he came and found them asleep not one but two more times ! —Matthew 26 :36-46 .
27 And Isaac said to them , Why have you come to me , seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you ?
Meetings of the Christian congregation often provide opportunities for us to make public declaration of our faith . One way in which we do that is by commenting in response to questions . How should we comment ? With a desire to bless , or speak well of , Jehovah . That is what the psalmist David did when “ among the congregated throngs . ” ( Ps . 26 :12 ) We should also comment in a manner that encourages fellow believers , inciting them “ to love and fine works , ” as the apostle Paul urged . ( Heb . 10 :23-25 ) Studying the lessons in advance can help us to accomplish this .

11 We need to obey Jesus because he is the way to God . The Bible says : “ There is no salvation in anyone else , for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved . ” ( Acts 4 :12 ) In Chapter 5 of this book , we learned that Jehovah sent Jesus to give his life as a ransom for obedient humans . ( Matthew 20 :28 ) Jehovah has chosen Jesus to rule as King over the earth . That is why the Bible tells us that we must obey Jesus if we want to live forever .—Read John 3 :36 .

8 . What is involved in worshipping Jehovah ?
20 Keep your eye focused . ( Read Matthew 6 :22 , 23 . ) This means keeping your life simple so that you can focus on serving Jehovah . We know that it would be foolish to allow money , a nice lifestyle , or the latest gadgets to become more important to us than our friendship with God . So , what will help us to put first things first ? We must try our best not to go into debt . If you are already in debt , make a practical plan to lower it or pay it off . If we are not careful , material things could take up a lot of our time and energy , and we may not take time to pray , study , or preach . Instead of allowing material things to make our life complicated , we want to learn to be content with basics such as “ food and clothing . ” ( 1 Timothy 6 :8 ) And whatever our situation , it is good to examine our circumstances from time to time to see how we can serve Jehovah more fully .

13 “ Pay Attention to How You Listen ”
8 The world ’ s “ air , ” or spirit , is an invisible , impelling force that incites disobedience to God and fosters “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes . ” ( 1 John 2 :16 ; 1 Timothy 6 :9 , 10 ) “ The authority ” of this spirit lies in its appeal to the sinful flesh , its subtlety , its relentlessness and , like air , its pervasiveness . Moreover , it is “ at work ” in disobedient humans by gradually nurturing in them ungodly traits , such as selfishness , haughtiness , greedy ambition , and the spirit of moral independence and rebellion . Simply put , the spirit of the world progressively causes the traits of the Devil to grow in the hearts of humans .—John 8 :44 ; Acts 13 :10 ; 1 John 3 :8 , 10 .

For there are more who are with us than those who are with them . ” 17 Then E·liʹsha began to pray and say : “ O Jehovah , open his eyes , please , that he may see . ” Immediately Jehovah opened the attendant ’ s eyes and he saw , and look ! the mountainous region was full of horses and war chariots of fire all around E·liʹsha .

Of course , since they loved serving their brothers , there was some initial disappointment .

25 In the fifth year of King Re·ho·boʹam , King Shiʹshak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem . 26 He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king ’ s house . He took everything , including all the gold shields that Solʹo·mon had made . 27 So King Re·ho·boʹam made copper shields to replace them , and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard , who guarded the entrance of the king ’ s house . 28 Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah , the guards would carry them , and then they would return them to the guard chamber .
6 After residing for years as a fugitive , David became king and lived in a comfortable house . Dismayed that there was no “ house , ” or temple , dedicated to Jehovah , he wanted to build one . So he said to Nathan the prophet : “ Here I am living in a house of cedars while the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under tent cloths . ” Nathan replied : “ Do whatever is in your heart , for the true God is with you . ” However , Jehovah directed otherwise . He told Nathan to tell David : “ You are not the one who will build the house for me to dwell in . ” Although Jehovah lovingly assured David that He would continue to bless him , God directed that David ’ s son Solomon build the temple . How did David react ? —1 Chron . 17 :1-4 , 8 , 11 , 12 ; 29 :1 .
14 Misuse of blood . In Noah ’ s day , God stated that it would be wrong to eat blood . He reaffirmed that position in the Law to the nation of Israel , and he similarly directed the Christian congregation to “ abstain . . . from blood . ” ( Acts 15 :20 , 29 ; Gen . 9 :4 ; Lev . 7 :26 ) Not surprisingly , Satan found a way in modern times to cause many to disregard this divine standard . Doctors were experimenting with blood transfusion in the 19th century , but after blood types were discovered , the practice became more widespread . In 1937 , blood began to be collected and stored in blood banks , and then World War II gave the practice a big push . Soon , transfusions became commonplace around the world .

5 We are dependent on the consistent and reliable laws of nature established by Jehovah . Electricians , plumbers , engineers , pilots , surgeons—all of them depend on these laws in order to do their work . For instance , surgeons count on the fact that the human anatomy is basically consistent . So a surgeon does not have to search for a patient ’ s heart . And all of us respect the laws of nature . Trying to defy the law of gravity might cost us our life !

3 The inhabitants of Gibʹe·on also heard what Joshua had done to Jerʹi·cho and Aʹi . 4 So they acted shrewdly and put provisions into worn-out sacks on their donkeys , along with worn-out wineskins that had burst and had been mended ; 5 they also had worn-out and patched sandals on their feet , and they were wearing worn-out garments . All the bread of their provisions was dry and crumbly . 6 Then they went to Joshua at the camp at Gilʹgal and said to him and the men of Israel : “ We have come from a distant land . Now make a covenant with us . ” 7 But the men of Israel said to the Hiʹvites : “ Perhaps you are living near us . So how can we make a covenant with you ? ” 8 They replied to Joshua : “ We are your servants . ”
11 I ask , then , God did not reject his people , did he ? By no means ! For I too am an Israelite , of the offspring of Abraham , from the tribe of Benjamin . 2 God did not reject his people , whom he first recognized . Do you not know what the scripture says in connection with E·liʹjah , as he pleads with God against Israel ? 3 “ Jehovah , they have killed your prophets , they have dug up your altars , and I alone am left , and now they are trying to take my life . ” 4 Yet , what does the divine pronouncement say to him ? “ I have left for myself 7 ,000 men who have not bent the knee to Baʹal . ” 5 So in the same way , at the present time also , there is a remnant according to a choosing through undeserved kindness . 6 Now if it is by undeserved kindness , it is no longer through works ; otherwise , the undeserved kindness would no longer be undeserved kindness .

4 So Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah and all the army chiefs and all the people disobeyed the voice of Jehovah to remain in the land of Judah . 5 Instead , Jo·haʹnan the son of Ka·reʹah and all the army chiefs took with them all the remnant of Judah who had returned to reside in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been dispersed . 6 They took the men , the women , the children , the daughters of the king , and everyone whom Neb·uʹzar·adʹan the chief of the guard had left with Ged·a·liʹah the son of A·hiʹkam the son of Shaʹphan , as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Barʹuch the son of Ne·riʹah . 7 And they went into the land of Egypt , for they did not obey the voice of Jehovah , and they went as far as Tahʹpan·hes .

6 Jehovah tells us : “ You must be holy , because I am holy . ” ( 1 Peter 1 :14-16 ; 2 Peter 3 :11 ) Jehovah will accept our worship only if it is holy , or clean . ( Deuteronomy 15 :21 ) Our worship can not be clean if we do things Jehovah hates , such as things that are immoral , violent , or connected with demonism . ( Romans 6 :12-14 ; 8 :13 ) But it would also displease Jehovah if we allowed ourselves to be entertained by such things . This could make our worship unclean and unacceptable to Jehovah and could seriously damage our relationship with him .
And covers the depths of the sea .
14 Why must we “ stop judging ” others ? For one thing , our authority is limited . The disciple James reminds us : “ One there is that is lawgiver and judge ” —Jehovah . So James pointedly asks : “ Who are you to be judging your neighbor ? ” ( James 4 :12 ; Romans 14 :1-4 ) In addition , our sinful nature can so easily render our judgments unfair . Many attitudes and motives—including prejudice , injured pride , jealousy , and self-righteousness—can distort the way we see fellow humans . We have further limitations , and reflecting on these should restrain us from being quick to find fault with others . We can not read hearts ; nor can we know all the personal circumstances of others . Who , then , are we to impute wrong motives to fellow believers or to criticize their efforts in God ’ s service ? How much better it is to imitate Jehovah by looking for the good in our brothers and sisters rather than focusing on their failings !
12 “ When you finish tithing the entire tenth of your produce in the third year , the year of the tenth , you will give it to the Levite , the foreign resident , the fatherless child , and the widow , and they will eat their fill within your cities . 13 You will then say before Jehovah your God , ‘ I have cleared the holy portion out of my house and given it to the Levite , the foreign resident , the fatherless child , and the widow , just as you have commanded me . I have not violated or neglected your commandments . 14 I have not eaten of it while mourning or removed any of it while unclean or given any of it for the dead . I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah my God and have done all that you commanded me . 15 Now look down from your holy dwelling , the heavens , and bless your people Israel and the land that you have given us , just as you swore to our forefathers , the land flowing with milk and honey . ’

Who of us can claim to be untouched by warfare , poverty , or racism ? And what about sickness and death ? Those conditions touch us all . They are the direct results of the rebellion against Jehovah on the part of three wicked individuals—Satan , Adam , and Eve . None of us can now escape the disorder that their rebellion unleashed .

But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest , and the one taking the lead as the one ministering . 27 For which one is greater , the one dining or the one serving ? Is it not the one dining ? But I am among you as the one serving .

14 What if our business involves some kind of joint venture , perhaps an investment or a loan ? The Bible provides an important and useful principle : Put everything down in writing ! For example , when Jeremiah bought a plot of land , he had a document made out in duplicate , duly witnessed , and safely stored for future reference . ( Jeremiah 32 :9-12 ; see also Genesis 23 :16-20 . ) When doing business with fellow believers , putting all the details into a carefully prepared , signed , and witnessed document does not imply distrust . Rather , it helps to prevent misunderstandings , disappointments , and even divisive disagreements from arising . Any Christians doing business together should keep in mind that no business venture is ever worth endangering the unity and peace of the congregation .—1 Corinthians 6 :1-8 .

Handling differences in the way that Jehovah instructs us to will result in our everlasting peace and happiness .—Isaiah 48 :17 .

23 Of course , that does not mean that Abraham and Sarah always saw things the same way . She once made a suggestion that was “ very displeasing ” to Abraham . Still , at Jehovah ’ s direction , Abraham humbly listened to the voice of his wife , which turned out to be a blessing to the family . ( Genesis 21 :9-13 ) Husbands and wives today , even those married for decades , can learn much from this godly couple .

Seeing that amazing growth in spite of harsh opposition convinced me that this is Jehovah ’ s work .

26 To remain in God ’ s love , we need to keep clean , not just in one or two respects but in all respects . Abandoning and keeping clear of defiling habits and practices may not be easy , but it is possible . Really , there is no better way to live , for Jehovah always teaches us to benefit ourselves . ( Read Isaiah 48 :17 . ) Most important , by keeping clean we can have the satisfaction that comes from knowing that we are reflecting favorably on the God we love , thereby remaining in his love .

He should give his sons an inheritance from his own property , so that no one among my people may be driven from his property . ’ ”

4 As we saw in Chapter 2 of this publication , after being enthroned in 1914 , Jesus came with his Father to inspect the spiritual temple—the arrangement for pure worship . As a result of that inspection , the King saw that anointed Christians , “ the sons of Levi , ” needed some refining and cleansing . ( Mal . 3 :1-3 ) From 1914 to early 1919 , the Refiner , Jehovah , allowed his people to go through various trials and hardships that served to refine and cleanse them . Happily , those anointed ones emerged from the fiery tests in a cleaner condition , eager to show their support for the Messianic King !

17 However , if some of the branches were broken off and you , although being a wild olive , were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the richness of the olive ’ s root , 18 do not be arrogant toward the branches . If , though , you are arrogant toward them , remember that it is not you who bears the root , but the root bears you . 19 You will say , then : “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in . ” 20 That is true ! For their lack of faith , they were broken off , but you are standing by faith . Do not be haughty , but be in fear . 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches , neither will he spare you . 22 Consider , therefore , God ’ s kindness and severity . There is severity toward those who fell , but toward you there is God ’ s kindness , provided you remain in his kindness ; otherwise , you too will be lopped off . 23 And they also , if they do not remain in their lack of faith , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them back in . 24 For if you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature and were grafted contrary to nature into the garden olive tree , how much more will these who are natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree !

Ananias and his wife sell some property to get money to help the newly baptized ones . When Ananias brings the money to the apostles , he says it is the total amount from the sale . But it is not ! He keeps some money for himself ! God lets Peter know this , so Peter tells Ananias : “ You have played false , not to men , but to God . ” At that , Ananias falls down dead ! About three hours later , his wife comes in . Not knowing what has happened to her husband , she also tells a lie and falls down dead .
I am not ashamed of the good news ; it is , in fact , God ’ s power for salvation to everyone having faith .—Rom . 1 :16 .
You may wonder , ‘ How can we know what Jehovah approves of if his Word provides no specific command on the matter ? ’ In the absence of a direct Bible law , how can we perceive the will of God ? By praying to him and accepting his guidance by holy spirit . Consider how Jesus perceived what his Father wanted him to do . On two reported occasions , Jesus first prayed and then miraculously provided food for large crowds . ( Matt . 14 :17-20 ; 15 :34-37 ) Yet , he refused to turn stones into bread when he was hungry and was tempted by the Devil in the wilderness . ( Matt . 4 :2-4 ) Because he was familiar with his Father ’ s thinking , Jesus knew that he should not turn the stones into bread . Yes , Jesus realized that it was not God ’ s will that he use such power for his own personal benefit . By refusing to do so , he showed that he was relying on Jehovah for guidance and sustenance . w16 .05 3 :7 , 8

I will return to my own country and to my relatives . ” 31 At this he said : “ Please do not leave us , for you know where we should camp in the wilderness , and you can serve as our guide . 32 And if you do come with us , whatever goodness Jehovah shows to us , we will surely show to you . ”
14 Then Samson went down to Timʹnah , and in Timʹnah he saw a Phi·lisʹtine woman . 2 So he went up and told his father and mother : “ In Timʹnah a Phi·lisʹtine woman caught my eye , and I want you to get her for me as a wife . ” 3 But his father and mother said to him : “ Can you not find a woman among your relatives and among all our people ? Must you go and take a wife from among the uncircumcised Phi·lisʹtines ? ” But Samson said to his father : “ Get her for me , because she is the right one for me . ” 4 His father and mother did not realize that this was from Jehovah , for He was looking for an opportunity against the Phi·lisʹtines , as the Phi·lisʹtines were ruling over Israel at that time .

Should anyone be put to death today in Israel ? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel ? ” 23 Then the king said to Shimʹe·i : “ You will not die . ” And the king gave him his oath .

4 Was Jesus referring only to the individual efforts of his followers , or was he alluding to an organized campaign to preach the good news ? Since one individual would not be able to go to “ all the nations , ” this work would require the organized efforts of many . Jesus indicated as much when he invited his disciples to become “ fishers of men . ” ( Read Matthew 4 :18-22 . ) The type of fishing he referred to here was not that of a lone fisherman using a line and a lure , sitting idly while waiting for the fish to bite . Rather , it involved the use of fishing nets—a labor-intensive activity that at times required the coordinated efforts of many .—Luke 5 :1-11 .

2 The temple in Jerusalem was dear to Jesus ’ heart . In all the world , it was the only sacred place dedicated to the worship of his heavenly Father . Jews from many lands traveled great distances to worship there . Even God-fearing Gentiles came , entering the temple courtyard set aside for their use . But early in his ministry , Jesus entered the temple area and met with an appalling sight . Why , the place was more like a market than a house of worship ! It was crowded with merchants and money brokers . Where , though , was the injustice ? For these men , God ’ s temple was merely a place to exploit people—even rob them . How so ? —John 2 :14 .

Jehovah has given each person free will , or the ability to make choices . He did not create us to be like robots . ( Deuteronomy 30 :19 ; Joshua 24 :15 ) We can use our freedom to make good choices . But if we are not careful , we could make unwise decisions . Having free will means that we must personally decide whether we want to be loyal to Jehovah and prove that we really love him .

5 Nearly three hundred times in the Hebrew Scriptures and twice in the Christian Greek Scriptures , God is given the title “ Jehovah of armies . ” ( 1 Samuel 1 :11 ) As Sovereign Ruler , Jehovah commands a vast army of angelic forces . ( Joshua 5 :13-15 ; 1 Kings 22 :19 ) The destructive potential of this army is awesome . ( Isaiah 37 :36 ) The destruction of humans is not pleasant to contemplate . However , we must remember that God ’ s wars are unlike petty human conflicts . Military and political leaders may try to attribute noble motives to their aggression . But human war invariably involves greed and selfishness .
You can recognize true worship by its works . You do not have to study all religions ; just study what the Bible says .
That was a challenging question . Some Jews debated which of the more than 600 laws that made up the Mosaic Law was first , or most important . Others , it seems , contended that all the laws were equally important and that it was wrong to give more weight to some than to others . How would Jesus respond to the question ?

After that they returned to Joshua at the camp in Shiʹloh . 10 Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiʹloh before Jehovah . There Joshua apportioned the land to the Israelites by their shares .

They moved to Cleveland , Tennessee , with two other sisters to serve where the need was greater . We missed them very much , but we were pleased that they were using their lives in the full-time service . Bethel and I then began to pioneer again , which opened up other joyful privileges for us . We did substitute circuit work and convention work .

It will be on the west side and on the east side . Its length from the western boundary to the eastern boundary will correspond to one of the tribal portions . 8 This land will become his possession in Israel . My chieftains will no longer mistreat my people , and they will give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes . ’

25 Then they went up from Egypt and came into the land of Caʹnaan to their father Jacob . 26 Then they reported to him : “ Joseph is still alive , and he is the ruler over all the land of Egypt ! ” But his heart grew numb because he did not believe them . 27 When they went on telling him all the words that Joseph had spoken to them and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of their father Jacob began to revive . 28 Israel exclaimed : “ It is enough ! My son Joseph is still alive ! I must go and see him before I die ! ”
2 In the year 1473 B .C .E . , a man named Balaam gave much thought to a lure . His intended prey , though , were God ’ s people , who were camped on the Plains of Moab , at the border of the Promised Land . Balaam professed to be a prophet of Jehovah , but he was really just a greedy man hired to curse Israel . However , through Jehovah ’ s intervention , Balaam was only able to bless Israel . Set on earning his reward , Balaam reasoned that perhaps he could induce God to curse his own people , if only they could be tempted to commit gross sin . With that goal in mind , Balaam cast the lure—the seductive young women of Moab .—Numbers 22 :1-7 ; 31 :15 , 16 ; Revelation 2 :14 .

Later , in the garden of Gethsemane , Peter needed correction more than once . Jesus asked him , as well as James and John , to keep on the watch while He prayed .

Adam and Eve could not have benefited from the ransom . The Mosaic Law stated this principle regarding a willful murderer : “ You must take no ransom for the soul of a murderer who is deserving to die . ” ( Numbers 35 :31 ) Clearly , Adam and Eve deserved to die because they willingly and knowingly disobeyed God . They thereby gave up their prospect of everlasting life .
17 If your parents never corrected you , would you not wonder if they really cared about you ? ( Heb . 12 :8 ) But perhaps it is the way your parents discipline you that upsets you . Rather than fret over the manner of discipline , try to recognize that there may be a reason for the way they act . So keep calm and do your best to avoid overreacting to criticism . God ’ s Word says : “ A man of knowledge restrains his words , and a discerning man will remain calm . ” ( Prov . 17 :27 ) Make it your goal to become a mature person who can take counsel calmly , benefiting from it without worrying excessively about how it was given . ( Prov . 1 :8 ) To have believing parents who truly love Jehovah is a blessing . They will surely want to help you to win the prize of life .

This allows us to understand the structure of the language , enabling us to speak it properly .

17 The way in which the Bible is written serves to test what is in our heart . Hebrews 4 :12 says : “ The word [ or , message ] of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit . . . and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart . ” The Bible ’ s message pierces deep , revealing our true thinking and motives . Those who read it with a critical heart are often stumbled by accounts that do not contain enough information to satisfy them . Such ones may even question whether Jehovah really is loving , wise , and just .

14 While maturity is attainable , there is always room for spiritual growth . Growth is dependent on food . Paul thus noted : “ Solid food belongs to mature people . ” A key to building up your faith is to keep taking in solid spiritual food . As you rightly apply what you learn , that is wisdom , and the Bible says : “ Wisdom is the most important thing . ” Thus , we need to develop a genuine hunger for the precious truths our Father imparts . ( Proverbs 4 :5-7 ; 1 Peter 2 :2 ) Of course , gaining knowledge and godly wisdom is no reason to become smug or haughty . We need to examine ourselves regularly lest pride or some other weakness takes root and grows in our heart . Paul wrote : “ Keep testing whether you are in the faith ; keep proving what you yourselves are . ” —2 Corinthians 13 :5 .

Instead , they will have the scourge with which Jehovah scourges the nations that do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Booths . 19 This will be the punishment for the sin of Egypt and the sin of all the nations that do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Booths .

7 By the time World War II broke out , Jehovah ’ s people as a whole had come to see more clearly what it meant to be neutral and what was required if they were to follow Jesus ’ example . ( Matt . 26 :51-53 ; John 17 :14-16 ; 1 Pet . 2 :21 ) For instance , the November 1 , 1939 , issue of The Watchtower carried the landmark article entitled “ Neutrality , ” which stated : “ The rule by which Jehovah ’ s covenant people must now be governed is that of strict neutrality between the nations at war . ” Regarding that article , Simon Kraker , who later served at headquarters , in Brooklyn , New York , said : “ I learned to appreciate that God ’ s people were to be at peace with everyone , even amid threats of war . ” That spiritual food was provided at the proper time and helped to brace God ’ s people for an unprecedented assault on their loyalty to the Kingdom .

However , I have spoken to you again and again , but you have not obeyed me . 15 And I kept sending all my servants the prophets to you , sending them again and again , saying , ‘ Turn back , please , each of you from your evil ways , and do what is right ! Do not walk after other gods and serve them . Then you will keep dwelling in the land that I gave to you and your forefathers . ’ But you did not incline your ear or listen to me . 16 The descendants of Je·honʹa·dab the son of Reʹchab have carried out the order that their forefather gave them , but these people have not listened to me . ” ’ ”

Look ! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison so that you may be fully put to the test , and you will have tribulation for ten days .

4 And I heard another voice out of heaven say : “ Get out of her , my people , if you do not want to share with her in her sins , and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues . 5 For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven , and God has called her acts of injustice to mind . 6 Repay her in the way she treated others , yes , pay her back double for the things she has done ; in the cup she has mixed , mix a double portion for her . 7 To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury , to that extent give her torment and mourning . For she keeps saying in her heart : ‘ I sit as queen , and I am not a widow , and I will never see mourning . ’ 8 That is why in one day her plagues will come , death and mourning and famine , and she will be completely burned with fire , because Jehovah God , who judged her , is strong .

6 What if love is lacking in us ? “ If I . . . do not have love , ” said the apostle Paul , “ I have become a sounding piece of brass or a clashing cymbal . ” ( 1 Corinthians 13 :1 ) A clashing cymbal produces a harsh noise . What about a sounding piece of brass ? Other versions say “ a noisy gong ” or “ a resounding gong . ” What apt illustrations ! A loveless person is like a musical instrument making a loud , jarring noise that repels rather than attracts . How could such a person enjoy a close relationship with others ? Paul also said : “ If I have all the faith so as to transplant mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing . ” ( 1 Corinthians 13 :2 ) Just imagine , a person without love is “ a useless nobody , ” despite any works that he might perform ! ( The Amplified Bible ) Is it not clear that Jehovah ’ s Word places a high value on showing love ?

11 When a husband and wife speak cruelly to each other , it causes emotional wounds that take a long time to heal . Clearly , that is not how Jehovah wants a husband and wife to treat each other . But it is possible to hurt your mate without even realizing it . You may feel that you are kind to your mate , but how does your mate feel ? If something you said hurt your mate , would you be willing to change ? —Galatians 5 :15 ; read Ephesians 4 :31 .
17 Therefore , Jesus ’ own function and that of the 144 ,000 will change in relation to the earth . What will their future activity be ? The Bible does not say . But if we faithfully uphold Jehovah ’ s sovereignty , we will be alive at the end of the Thousand Year Reign to find out what Jehovah has purposed for them as well as for his awesome universe . Nevertheless , Christ ’ s thousand-year rulership will be “ indefinitely lasting ” and his Kingdom “ will not be brought to ruin . ” ( Daniel 7 :14 ) In what sense ? For one thing , the ruling authority will not pass into the hands of others who have different aims , as Jehovah will be Ruler . Also , the Kingdom “ will never be brought to ruin ” because its accomplishments will endure forever . ( Daniel 2 :44 ) And the Messianic King-Priest and his associate king-priests will forever be honored because of their faithful service to Jehovah .

They consider it an honor to address Jehovah as Father and to submit to him as their Potter .

Do you similarly see each of your spiritual brothers and sisters as a work in progress , being molded by God ? To help us in that regard , let us consider three aspects of Jehovah ’ s work as our Potter : How he chooses those whom he molds , why he molds them , and how he does so .

Today , marital treachery can not be tolerated among Jehovah ’ s people . But suppose a baptized married man or woman ran off with another person ’ s mate and married that one after obtaining a divorce . If he is unrepentant , the wrongdoer would be disfellowshipped in order to maintain the spiritual purity of the congregation . ( 1 Cor . 5 :11-13 ) He or she would have to “ produce fruits that befit repentance ” before being accepted back into the congregation . ( Luke 3 :8 ; 2 Cor . 2 :5-10 ) Though no set time must pass before that person ’ s reinstatement , such treachery , which seldom occurs among those associated with God ’ s people , can not be ignored . It might take quite some time—a year or more—for the sinner to give proof of true repentance . Even if the person is reinstated , he or she must still render an account “ before the judgment seat of God . ” —Rom . 14 :10-12 . w16 .08 1 :12 , 13

16 If your spiritual progress seems slow , remember that such growth takes time . The cultivating of spiritual qualities is an ongoing process . We must be patient as we endeavor to let the Bible continue to produce positive changes in our life . At first , we may need to discipline ourselves to do what is Scripturally right . In time , though , thinking and acting in a godly way will likely become easier and more natural for us as our thoughts and actions progressively line up with those of Jehovah God .—Ps . 37 :31 ; Prov . 23 :12 ; Gal . 5 :16 , 17 .

Do you see yourself being molded in his caring hands ? If so , what additional qualities will help you to remain like soft and malleable clay before Jehovah ? What traits should you avoid so that you are not hard or inflexible ? And how can parents cooperate with Jehovah in molding their children ? The following article will address these matters .

11 Moses was another person who upheld Jehovah ’ s sovereignty . And he did this under the most difficult circumstances—in face-to-face confrontations with Pharaoh of Egypt . Not that Moses was self-confident . On the contrary , he doubted his ability to speak well enough . But he obeyed Jehovah . With Jehovah ’ s backing and the aid of his brother , Aaron , Moses repeatedly delivered Jehovah ’ s word to obstinate Pharaoh . Even some of the sons of Israel were harshly critical of Moses . Yet , Moses loyally did everything that Jehovah commanded him , and by means of him , Israel was delivered from Egypt .—Exodus 7 :6 ; 12 :50 , 51 ; Hebrews 11 :24-27 .

16 However , those servants of God did not allow such normal aspects of life to become the center of their lives . After showing that Paul worked as a tentmaker , the record reveals what his life was centered on : He regularly gave attention to the Christian preaching and teaching work .

Yes , Paul ’ s life centered on spiritual provisions and activities . The Romans needed to imitate him , and so do we .—Rom . 15 :15 , 16 .

JEHOVAH instructed all Israelite males to gather at Jerusalem three times a year . ( Ex . 23 :14-17 ; Lev . 23 :34-36 ) Jesus ’ adoptive father , Joseph , took his whole family to Jerusalem on such occasions . Other Israelite men likely did the same . God ’ s people today likewise gather three times each year for assemblies and conventions . Some of the conventions have marked outstanding milestones in the development of the earthly part of God ’ s organization during the last days . Consider just some of these conventions and what made them memorable .

( Psalm 37 :29 ; Revelation 20 :11 , 12 ; 21 :3 , 4 ) Eternal life is “ the gift God gives . . . by Christ Jesus our Lord . ” ( Romans 6 :23 ; Ephesians 2 :8-10 ) If we have faith in that gift and appreciation for the manner in which it was made possible , we will make this manifest . Discerning how marvelously Jehovah has used Jesus in accomplishing His will and how vital it is that all of us follow Jesus ’ steps closely , we will make the Christian ministry one of the most important activities in our life . Our faith will be evident from the conviction with which we tell others about this magnificent gift from God .—Acts 20 :24 .
12 The apostle Paul wrote : “ Let us work what is good toward all , but especially toward those related to us in the faith . ” ( Galatians 6 :10 ) As Christians , we have an obligation to show love for those who are related to us in the faith—our spiritual brothers and sisters . How important is this love ? Making this powerful point , the apostle John wrote : “ Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer . . . If anyone makes the statement : ‘ I love God , ’ and yet is hating his brother , he is a liar . For he who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , can not be loving God , whom he has not seen . ” ( 1 John 3 :15 ; 4 :20 ) These are strong words . Jesus Christ applied the words “ manslayer ” and “ liar ” to Satan the Devil . ( John 8 :44 ) Never would we want those terms applied to us !
9 David and Jonathan are another example of good friends who were both loyal to Jehovah . Jonathan was about 30 years older than David and was next in line to be king of Israel . ( 1 Samuel 17 :33 ; 31 :2 ; 2 Samuel 5 :4 ) Yet , when he learned that Jehovah had chosen David to be king , he did not feel jealous or competitive . Instead , Jonathan did everything he could to support David . For example , when David was in danger , Jonathan helped him “ find strength in Jehovah . ” He even risked his life for David . ( 1 Samuel 23 :16 , 17 ) David too was a loyal friend . He promised to take care of Jonathan ’ s family , and he kept that promise even after Jonathan died .—1 Samuel 18 :1 ; 20 :15-17 , 30-34 ; 2 Samuel 9 :1-7 .

18 As grateful recipients of Jehovah ’ s kindness , we owe it to him and to our neighbor to use our gifts to honor God and benefit our fellow man . In what ways ? Paul answers : “ Since , then , we have gifts that differ according to the undeserved kindness given to us . . . if it is a ministry , let us be at this ministry ; or the one who teaches , let him be at his teaching ; or the one who encourages , let him give encouragement ; . . . the one who shows mercy , let him do it cheerfully . ” ( Rom . 12 :6-8 ) The undeserved kindness that Jehovah extends to us puts us under obligation to busy ourselves in the Christian ministry , to teach the Bible to others , to encourage fellow Christians , and to forgive any who may offend us .

9 Using obscene , or unclean , language is very common today . Many think that they need to swear and use vulgar words to get their point across . Comedians often rely on dirty jokes and obscene language to make people laugh . However , the apostle Paul said : “ You must put them all away from you : wrath , anger , badness , abusive speech , and obscene talk out of your mouth . ” ( Colossians 3 :8 ) He also said that “ obscene jesting ” should “ not even be mentioned among ” true Christians .—Ephesians 5 :3 , 4 .

“ What I teach is not mine , ” Jesus explains , “ but belongs to him who sent me . If anyone desires to do His will , he will know whether the teaching is from God or I speak of my own originality . ” ( John 7 :16 , 17 ) Jesus ’ teaching is in harmony with God ’ s Law , so it should be obvious that he is seeking God ’ s glory , not his own .

“ The works of the flesh are manifest , ” wrote the apostle Paul , “ and they are fornication , uncleanness , loose conduct . ” ( Gal . 5 :19 ) Fornication has to do with all sexual activity involving the use of the genital organs that is carried on outside the bonds of marriage . Loose conduct involves “ licentiousness ; wantonness ; shameless conduct ; lewdness of conduct . ” Both fornication and loose conduct are clearly contrary to Jehovah ’ s holiness . Hence , those who continue to practice such things are not allowed to become part of the Christian congregation or are disfellowshipped from it . The same is true of those who practice gross uncleanness , that is , “ uncleanness of every sort with greediness . ” —Eph . 4 :19 .

WE LIVE in very stressful times . Satan the Devil is bitterly angry and “ walks about like a roaring lion , seeking to devour someone . ” ( 1 Pet . 5 :8 ; Rev . 12 :17 ) Therefore , it is not surprising that at times even we , God ’ s servants , experience some feelings of anxiety . After all , on occasion , God-fearing servants of Jehovah in the past , such as King David , had “ anxious concern . ” ( Ps . 13 :2 ) Recall , too , that the apostle Paul experienced “ anxiety for all the congregations . ” ( 2 Cor . 11 :28 ) But what can we do when we are overwhelmed by feelings of anxiety ?
2 Throughout history , faithful servants of Jehovah have asked similar questions . For example , the prophet Habakkuk prayed to God : “ Why do you make me watch such terrible injustice ? Why do you allow violence , lawlessness , crime , and cruelty to spread everywhere ? ” ( Habakkuk 1 :3 , Contemporary English Version ) Jehovah did not censure Habakkuk for his candid inquiry , for He is the one who instilled in humans the very concept of justice . Yes , Jehovah has blessed us with a small measure of his profound sense of justice .

4 The Greek word translated “ boldness ” means “ outspokenness , frankness , plainness . ” That word conveys the idea of “ courage , confidence , . . . fearlessness . ” Boldness does not mean bluntness or rudeness . ( Col . 4 :6 ) While being bold , we also want to be peaceable with all . ( Rom . 12 :18 ) Moreover , as we preach the good news of God ’ s Kingdom , we need to maintain balance between boldness and tactfulness so that we do not offend someone unintentionally . Indeed , boldness calls for qualities that require much effort to cultivate . This type of boldness does not come from within or from self-reliance . After the apostle Paul and his companions had been ‘ insolently treated in Philippi , ’ how did they ‘ muster up boldness ’ to speak to those in Thessalonica ? “ By means of our God , ” wrote Paul . ( Read 1 Thessalonians 2 :2 . ) Jehovah God can dispel our fears and give us similar boldness .

21 Jehovah then said to Moses : “ Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt , a darkness so thick that it can be felt . ” 22 Moses immediately stretched out his hand toward the heavens , and there was a dense darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days . 23 They did not see one another , and none of them got up from where they were for three days ; but all the Israelites had light in their dwellings . 24 Pharʹaoh then called Moses and said : “ Go , serve Jehovah . Only your sheep and your cattle will remain behind . Even your children may go with you . ” 25 But Moses said : “ You yourself will also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings , and we will offer them to Jehovah our God . 26 Our livestock will also go with us . Not an animal will be allowed to remain , because we will be using some of them to worship Jehovah our God , and we do not know what we will offer in worship to Jehovah until we arrive there . ” 27 So Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh ’ s heart to become obstinate , and he did not consent to send them away . 28 Pharʹaoh said to him : “ Get out of my sight ! Make sure that you do not try to see my face again , for on the day you see my face , you will die . ” 29 To this Moses said : “ Just as you have spoken , I will not try to see your face again . ”
15 If we want to remain close to Jehovah , we also need to talk to others about our faith . Talking to others about Jehovah is a wonderful privilege . ( Luke 1 :74 ) And it ’ s a responsibility that Jesus gave to all true Christians . Each of us should preach the good news of God ’ s Kingdom . Have you already done this ? —Matthew 24 :14 ; 28 :19 , 20 .

2 In the Court of the Gentiles , greedy merchants and money changers were taking unfair advantage of the worshippers who came to present offerings to Jehovah . Jesus “ threw out all those selling and buying in the temple , and he overturned the tables of the money changers . ” ( Compare Nehemiah 13 :7-9 . ) He denounced those selfish men for turning his Father ’ s house into “ a cave of robbers . ” Jesus thereby showed his respect for the temple and what it represented . The worship of his Father had to be kept clean !
Most imperfect humans are strongly influenced by the spirit of Satan ’ s world . That is why people tend to idolize certain men or women rather than just show them appropriate honor and respect . They place religious and political leaders , sports figures , entertainment stars , and other celebrities on pedestals , often considering them to be almost superhuman . Hence , young and old alike look to them as role models , perhaps imitating their mannerisms , dress , or conduct . True Christians refrain from such a distorted view of honoring humans . Christ is the only human who ever lived whom we can consider a perfect role model . ( 1 Pet . 2 :21 ) God would not be pleased if we extended to humans more honor than they are due . We need to bear in mind this basic truth : “ All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . ” ( Rom . 3 :23 ) Truly , no human warrants the kind of honor that borders on idolatry . w17 .03 1 :6-8

14 Bear in mind , too , that we can approach the “ Hearer of prayer ” with the confidence that he will give attention to our concerns . ( Ps . 65 :2 ) “ The Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort ” will unstintingly give us the emotional and spiritual support that we need , perhaps doing so by means of our fellow worshippers . ( 2 Cor . 1 :3 ) It touches Jehovah ’ s heart when we show compassion toward others . “ The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah , and He will repay him for what he does . ” ( Prov . 19 :17 ; Matt . 6 :3 , 4 ) Hence , when we unselfishly help those who are in difficulty , Jehovah views our good deed as a loan made to Him . And he promises to reward that kindness .
Your end has come , the limit of your profit-making .
8 Now this is the main point of what we are saying : We have such a high priest as this , and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens , 2 a minister of the holy place and of the true tent , which Jehovah set up , and not man . 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices ; so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer . 4 If he were on earth , he would not be a priest , since there are already men who offer the gifts according to the Law . 5 These men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things ; just as Moses , when about to construct the tent , was given the divine command : For He says : “ See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain . ” 6 But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry because he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant , which has been legally established on better promises .

Here is what Jehovah says to you , ‘ Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd , for the battle is not yours but God ’ s . 16 Tomorrow go down against them . They will be coming up by the pass of Ziz , and you will find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of Je·ruʹel . 17 You will not need to fight this battle . Take your position , stand still , and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf . O Judah and Jerusalem , do not be afraid or be terrified . Tomorrow go out against them , and Jehovah will be with you . ’ ”

16 First-century Jews and Gentiles needed to repent of their sins and to exercise faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice . Otherwise , they could have no forgiveness . The situation is the same today . ( John 3 :16 , 36 ) If a person clings to false doctrines , such as the Trinity and the immortality of the soul , he can not benefit from the ransom . But we can . We know the truth about “ the Son of [ God ’ s ] love , by means of whom we have our release by ransom , the forgiveness of our sins . ” —Col . 1 :13 , 14 .
WHY IMPORTANT : On the night before his death , Jesus prayed that his disciples would “ be completely unified . ” ( Joh 17 :23 , ftn . ) To remain united , we must display love , which “ does not keep account of the injury . ” —1Co 13 :5 .

7 When Daniel and his companions were exiled , the Babylonians tried to assimilate them into their culture by teaching them “ the language of the Chaldeans . ” Moreover , the court official in charge of their training gave them Babylonian names .

King Nebuchadnezzar likely wanted to impress Daniel with the idea that his God , Jehovah , had been subjected by Babylon ’ s god .—Dan . 4 :8 .
▸ Chapter 13 , paragraph 22
About a thousand years after the Hebrew Scriptures were completed , Jewish scholars developed a system of pronunciation points , or signs , by which to indicate what vowels to use when reading Hebrew . By that time , though , many Jews had the superstitious idea that it was wrong to say God ’ s personal name out loud , so they used substitute expressions . Thus , it seems that when they copied the Tetragrammaton , they combined the vowels for the substitute expressions with the four consonants representing the divine name . Therefore , the manuscripts with those vowel points do not help in determining how the name was originally pronounced in Hebrew . Some feel that the name was pronounced “ Yahweh , ” whereas others suggest different possibilities . A Dead Sea Scroll containing a portion of Leviticus in Greek transliterates the divine name Iao . Besides that form , early Greek writers also suggest the pronunciations Iae , I·a·beʹ , and I·a·ou·eʹ . However , there is no reason to be dogmatic . We simply do not know how God ’ s ancient servants pronounced this name in Hebrew . ( Genesis 13 :4 ; Exodus 3 :15 ) What we do know is that God used his name repeatedly in communication with his people , that they addressed him by that name , and that they used it freely in speaking with others .—Exodus 6 :2 ; 1 Kings 8 :23 ; Psalm 99 :9 .

7 How should we view setbacks in our efforts to pursue righteousness ? Of course , we would not want to minimize the seriousness of sin . At the same time , we must never give up , feeling that our shortcomings make us unfit to serve Jehovah . Our gracious God has made provision to restore sincerely repentant ones to his favor . Consider the reassuring words of the apostle John : “ I am writing you these things that you may not commit a sin . ” But then he realistically added : “ Yet , if anyone does commit a sin [ because of inherited imperfection ] , we have a helper with the Father , Jesus Christ . ” ( 1 John 2 :1 ) Yes , Jehovah has provided Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice so that we might acceptably serve Him in spite of our sinful nature .

4 Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes , and he became his personal attendant . So he appointed him over his house , and he put him in charge of all that was his . 5 From the time he appointed him over his house and in charge of all that was his , Jehovah kept blessing the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph , and Jehovah ’ s blessing came to be on all that he had in the house and in the field . 6 He eventually left everything that was his in Joseph ’ s care , and he gave no thought to anything except the food he was eating . Moreover , Joseph grew to be well-built and handsome .

20 When David returned to bless his own household , Saul ’ s daughter Miʹchal came out to meet him . She said : “ How glorious the king of Israel made himself when he uncovered himself today before the eyes of the slave girls of his servants , just as an empty-headed man openly uncovers himself ! ” 21 At this David said to Miʹchal : “ My celebration was before Jehovah , who chose me rather than your father and all his household and who appointed me as leader over Jehovah ’ s people , Israel . Therefore , I will celebrate before Jehovah , 22 and I will humble myself even more than this and become low even in my own eyes . But by the slave girls whom you mentioned , I will be glorified . ” 23 So Saul ’ s daughter Miʹchal had no children down to the day of her death .

20 While she was riding on the donkey and going down under cover of the mountain , just then David and his men were coming down toward her , and she met them . 21 Now David had been saying : “ It was for nothing that I guarded everything that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness . Not a single thing belonging to him went missing , and yet he repays me evil for good . 22 May God do the same and more to the enemies of David if I allow a single male of his to survive until the morning . ”

Observant people without spiritual comprehension can study the universe , world events , and even themselves but fail to comprehend the real meaning of what they are seeing . On the other hand , with the help of God ’ s spirit , people who regularly study God ’ s Word can discern in these things the handiwork of God , the fulfillment of Bible prophecy , and the unfolding of God ’ s purpose for blessing obedient humans .—Mark 13 :4-29 ; Rom . 1 :20 ; Rev . 12 :12 .
6 The roots of Christmas are found , not in Scripture , but in ancient pagan festivals , such as the Roman Saturnalia , a celebration dedicated to Saturn , the god of agriculture . Likewise , according to their reckoning , devotees of the god Mithra celebrated December 25 as the “ birthday of the invincible sun , ” says the New Catholic Encyclopedia . “ Christmas originated at a time when the cult of the sun was particularly strong at Rome , ” about three centuries after the death of Christ .
10 Abraham and Sarah were also fine examples of upholding Jehovah ’ s sovereignty , doing whatever he commanded them . They lived in Ur of the Chaldeans , a prosperous city . But when Jehovah told Abraham to go to another land , one that he was not familiar with , Abraham “ went just as Jehovah had spoken to him . ” Sarah no doubt had had a comfortable way of life—with home , friends , and relatives . Yet , she was submissive to Jehovah and to her husband and went to the land of Canaan , although she did not know what conditions awaited her there .—Genesis 11 :31–12 :4 ; Acts 7 :2-4 .
8 Then Jehovah said to Aaron : 9 “ Do not drink wine or other alcoholic beverages , you and your sons with you , when you come into the tent of meeting , so that you will not die . It is a permanent statute for your generations . 10 This is to distinguish between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean , 11 and to teach the Israelites all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them through Moses . ”

Bring your letter to a close before the recipient might tire of reading it . It would be appropriate to enclose a printed invitation to meetings at the Kingdom Hall . You could include a tract , a brochure , or an issue of The Watchtower or Awake ! and explain that these can be provided on a regular basis if desired . Or you could ask if a visit may be made to the recipient ’ s home to speak with him further on the subject discussed .

21 Now the men of Israel had sworn this oath in Mizʹpah : “ Not one of us will give his daughter to a man from Benjamin as a wife . ” 2 Consequently , the people came to Bethʹel and sat there before the true God until evening , crying out and weeping bitterly . 3 And they were saying : “ Why , O Jehovah the God of Israel , has this happened in Israel ? Why should one tribe be missing today from Israel ? ” 4 And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there to offer up burnt offerings and communion offerings .

8 When the women of Israel began praising David for his military prowess , King Saul became so consumed with jealousy that on two occasions he hurled his spear at David . ( 1 Sam . 18 :6-9 ) Both times David escaped the sharp tip of the spear . Was this simply because of David ’ s skill and agility as an experienced warrior ? No . The Bible record explains that “ Jehovah was with him . ” ( Read 1 Samuel 18 :11-14 . ) Later , when Saul ’ s scheme to have David killed by the Philistines failed , “ Saul got to see and know that Jehovah was with David . ” —1 Sam . 18 :17-28 .

16 At the end of three days , after they made a covenant with them , they heard that they lived nearby , in their vicinity . 17 Then the Israelites set out and came to their cities on the third day ; their cities were Gibʹe·on , Che·phiʹrah , Be·erʹoth , and Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim . 18 But the Israelites did not attack them , because the chieftains of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by Jehovah the God of Israel . So all the assembly began to murmur against the chieftains . 19 At this all the chieftains said to the entire assembly : “ Since we swore an oath to them by Jehovah the God of Israel , we are not allowed to hurt them . 20 This is what we will do : We will let them live , so that there is no indignation against us because of the oath that we swore to them . ” 21 And the chieftains added : “ Let them live , but let them become gatherers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly . ” This is what the chieftains promised them .

20 Jehovah sees your faith and endurance . ( Isaiah 30 :18 ; read Malachi 3 :10 . ) He promises to “ grant you the desires of your heart . ” ( Psalm 37 :4 ) So keep your mind focused on your hope . Satan wants you to lose hope and to feel that Jehovah ’ s promises will never come true . But you can not give in to negative thinking ! If you notice that your hope is becoming less real to you , ask Jehovah for help . Remember the words found at Philippians 4 :6 , 7 : “ Do not be anxious over anything , but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving , let your petitions be made known to God ; and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus . ”

Jehovah gave David victory wherever he went . 14 David kept reigning over all Israel , and he was administering justice and righteousness for all his people . 15 Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah was over the army , Je·hoshʹa·phat the son of A·hiʹlud was recorder , 16 Zaʹdok the son of A·hiʹtub and A·himʹe·lech the son of A·biʹa·thar were priests , and Shavʹsha was secretary . 17 Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da was over the Cherʹe·thites and the Pelʹe·thites .

Thousands of Witnesses were victimized ; hundreds were killed in concentration camps . Did Hitler succeed in his campaign to eradicate the Witnesses ? Did he stop all preaching of the good news in Germany ? By no means ! During the persecution , our brothers carried on the preaching work underground . After the collapse of the Nazi regime , they used their freedom to continue preaching . Today , there are over 165 ,000 Kingdom publishers in Germany . Again , “ the Provider of escape ” has proved true to his promise : “ Any weapon . . . formed against you will have no success . ”
43 Indeed , fear began to fall upon everyone , and many wonders and signs began to occur through the apostles . 44 All those who became believers were together and had everything in common , 45 and they were selling their possessions and properties and distributing the proceeds to all , according to what each one needed . 46 And day after day they were in constant attendance in the temple with a united purpose , and they took their meals in different homes and shared their food with great rejoicing and sincerity of heart , 47 praising God and finding favor with all the people . At the same time Jehovah continued to add to them daily those being saved .

57 Now as it was late in the afternoon , a rich man of Ar·i·ma·theʹa came , named Joseph , who had also become a disciple of Jesus . 58 This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him . 59 Joseph took the body , wrapped it up in clean , fine linen , 60 and laid it in his new tomb , which he had quarried in the rock . And after rolling a big stone to the entrance of the tomb , he left . 61 But Mary Magʹda·lene and the other Mary continued there , sitting before the grave .

7 To put into perspective what Jesus was willing to do , think about this : What man would leave his family and home and move to a foreign land if he knew that most of its inhabitants would reject him , that he would be subjected to humiliation and suffering , and that he would finally be murdered ? Consider now what Jesus did . Before coming to earth , he had a favored position in the heavens alongside his Father . Yet , Jesus willingly left his heavenly home and came to earth as a human . He made this move , knowing that he would be rejected by the majority and that he would be subjected to cruel humiliation , intense suffering , and a painful death . ( Philippians 2 :5-7 ) What motivated Jesus to make such a sacrifice ?

10 Another example in ancient times of someone in need of encouragement is Jephthah ’ s daughter . Before going out to combat the Ammonites , Judge Jephthah vowed that if Jehovah gave him the victory , the first person who would come out to meet him after the battle would be devoted to Jehovah ’ s service at the sanctuary . It so happened that it was his daughter , his only child , who came out to celebrate his victory with him . Jephthah ’ s heart was broken . But he kept his vow and sent his virgin daughter to Shiloh to serve at the tabernacle for the rest of her life .—Judg . 11 :30-35 .
As the number of pioneers increased sharply , responsible brothers considered practical ways to support this growing army . Jim Carr , serving as a zone servant ( now known as a circuit overseer ) in 1938 , followed the suggestion to set up pioneer homes in cities . Groups of pioneers were encouraged to live and work together , thus cutting costs . In Sheffield , they rented a large house , to be overseen by a responsible brother . The local congregation contributed funds and furniture . Jim recalled : “ Everyone worked to make it a success . ” Ten hardworking pioneers lived there , keeping up a good spiritual routine . “ The [ day ’ s ] text was discussed each morning at the breakfast table , ” and “ the pioneers went daily to their territory in various parts of the city . ”

Our conscience is our inner sense of right and wrong . Jehovah has given each of us a conscience . ( Romans 2 :14 , 15 ) For our conscience to work correctly , we must train it according to Jehovah ’ s moral standards . Then our conscience can help us make decisions that please God . ( 1 Peter 3 :16 ) Our conscience can warn us when we are about to make a foolish choice , or it can make us feel deep pain after we have done something wrong . Our conscience can become weak , but with Jehovah ’ s help , we can make it strong again . A good conscience gives us peace of mind and self-respect .

By carefully examining such examples , we can learn what we must do and must not do in order for our worship to be pleasing to God .
Your previous education must be sufficient . If you have obtained a diploma in your country of origin , you can have it evaluated by International Credential Evaluation . On the basis of this evaluation , the educational institutes determine whether your previous education is sufficient and whether you may even be granted an exemption for all or part of the course . If you do not have a diploma and / or your previous education is insufficient , you must sit for an entrance examination : the 21+ admission test . Ask the institution where you wish to attend your course for more information about this .

22 And he traveled from city to city and from village to village , teaching and continuing on his journey to Jerusalem . 23 Now a man said to him : “ Lord , are those being saved few ? ” He said to them : 24 “ Exert yourselves vigorously to get in through the narrow door , because many , I tell you , will seek to get in but will not be able . 25 When the householder gets up and locks the door , you will stand outside knocking at the door , saying , ‘ Lord , open to us . ’ But in answer he will say to you : ‘ I do not know where you are from . ’ 26 Then you will start saying , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our main streets . ’ 27 But he will say to you , ‘ I do not know where you are from . Get away from me , all you workers of unrighteousness ! ’ 28 There is where your weeping and the gnashing of your teeth will be , when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God , but you yourselves thrown outside . 29 Furthermore , people will come from east and west and from north and south , and will recline at the table in the Kingdom of God . 30 And look ! there are those last who will be first , and there are those first who will be last . ”
9 But a prophet of Jehovah named Oʹded was there . He went out before the army that was coming to Sa·marʹi·a and said to them : “ Look ! It was because Jehovah the God of your forefathers was angry with Judah that he gave them into your hand , and you slaughtered them with a fury that has reached clear to the heavens . 10 And now you intend to make the people of Judah and Jerusalem your male and female servants . Nevertheless , are you not also guilty before Jehovah your God ? 11 Now listen to me and return the captives whom you took from your brothers , for Jehovah ’ s burning anger is against you . ”

29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him , and he said : “ See , the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world ! 30 This is the one about whom I said : ‘ Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me , for he existed before me . ’ 31 Even I did not know him , but the reason why I came baptizing in water was so that he might be made manifest to Israel . ” 32 John also bore witness , saying : “ I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven , and it remained upon him . 33 Even I did not know him , but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me : ‘ Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining , this is the one who baptizes in holy spirit . ’ 34 And I have seen it , and I have given witness that this one is the Son of God . ”

10 Like Jesus , we show our love by being obedient to God . “ This is what love means , ” writes Jesus ’ beloved apostle John , “ that we go on walking according to his commandments . ” ( 2 John 6 ) Those who truly love Jehovah long for his guidance . Recognizing that they can not successfully direct their own steps , they trust in God ’ s wisdom and submit to his loving direction . ( Jeremiah 10 :23 ) They are like the noble-minded ones in ancient Beroea who accepted God ’ s message with “ eagerness of mind , ” having a keen desire to do the will of God . ( Acts 17 :11 ) They carefully examined the Scriptures to understand the will of God more fully , which helped them express love in further acts of obedience .
25 Then Moses got up and went to Daʹthan and A·biʹram , and the elders of Israel went with him . 26 He told the assembly : “ Move away , please , from the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them , so that you may not be swept away in all their sin . ” 27 They immediately moved away from the tents of Korʹah , Daʹthan , and A·biʹram , from every side , and Daʹthan and A·biʹram came out , taking their stand at the entrance of their tents , together with their wives , their sons , and their little children .
18 “ Now listen to the illustration of the man who sowed . 19 Where anyone hears the word of the Kingdom but does not get the sense of it , the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart ; this is the one sown alongside the road . 20 As for the one sown on rocky ground , this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy . 21 Yet , he has no root in himself but continues for a time , and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word , he is at once stumbled . 22 As for the one sown among the thorns , this is the one hearing the word , but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful . 23 As for the one sown upon the fine soil , this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it , who really does bear fruit and produces , this one 100 times more , that one 60 , the other 30 . ”
11 “ So you came near and stood at the base of the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire up to the very heavens ; there was darkness , cloud , and thick gloom . 12 And Jehovah began to speak to you out of the fire . You heard the sound of words , but you saw no form—there was only a voice . 13 And he declared his covenant to you , which he commanded you to observe—the Ten Commandments . Afterward , he wrote them on two tablets of stone . 14 At that time Jehovah commanded me to teach you regulations and judicial decisions , which you are to observe in the land you will enter to take possession of .

The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me . ”

17 “ Gracious . ” This quality tells us much about Jehovah ’ s manner of dealing with his creatures . Instead of being brusque , cold , or tyrannical , as is often true of the powerful , Jehovah is gentle and kind . For example , Jehovah said to Abram : “ Raise your eyes , please , and look from the place where you are , northward and southward and eastward and westward . ” ( Genesis 13 :14 ) Many translations omit the word “ please . ” But Bible scholars note that the wording in the original Hebrew includes a word particle that changes the statement from a command to a polite request . There are other , similar instances . ( Genesis 31 :12 ; Ezekiel 8 :5 ) Imagine , the Sovereign of the universe says “ please ” to mere humans ! In a world where harshness , pushiness , and rudeness are so common , is it not refreshing to contemplate the graciousness of our God , Jehovah ?

In September 2002 , he began serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence but was released after serving ten and a half months . During that time , he appealed to the ECHR , which heard his case . However , on October 27 , 2009 , that Court also ruled against him . The verdict seemed to be a crushing blow to the brothers in Armenia who faced this issue . However , the Grand Chamber of the ECHR reviewed the ruling . On July 7 , 2011 , the Court ruled in favor of Vahan Bayatyan . This was the first time that the ECHR recognized that conscientious objection to military service based on one ’ s religious beliefs should be protected under the right of freedom of thought , conscience , and religion . That ruling protects the rights not only of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses but of hundreds of millions of people in countries that are members of the Council of Europe .
31 But Moses called to them , so Aaron and all the chieftains of the assembly came to him , and Moses spoke with them . 32 After that all the Israelites came near to him , and he gave them all the commands that Jehovah had given him on Mount Siʹnai . 33 When Moses would finish speaking with them , he would put a veil over his face . 34 But when Moses would go in before Jehovah to speak with him , he would take off the veil until he went out . Then he went out and revealed to the Israelites the commands he had received . 35 And the Israelites saw that the skin of Moses ’ face emitted rays ; then Moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with God .

5 Consider , too , Jehovah ’ s strong criticism of the unjust leaders in Israel . “ Is it not your business to know justice ? ” he inspired his prophet to ask them . After describing in graphic terms their abuse of power , Jehovah foretold the outcome for these corrupt men : “ They will call to Jehovah for aid , but he will not answer them . And he will conceal his face from them in that time , according as they committed badness in their dealings . ” ( Micah 3 :1-4 ) What an aversion Jehovah has to injustice ! Why , he himself has experienced it firsthand ! For thousands of years , Satan has been unjustly taunting him . ( Proverbs 27 :11 ) Furthermore , Jehovah was touched by the most horrendous act of injustice when his Son , who “ committed no sin , ” was executed as a criminal . ( 1 Peter 2 :22 ; Isaiah 53 :9 ) Clearly , Jehovah is neither oblivious of nor indifferent to the plight of those who suffer injustice .
32 And whoever says a word against the Son of man , will have forgiveness ; but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit , will not have forgiveness in this life or in that which is to come .
But whoever hates reproof will die .
13 “ O you who are dwelling in the gardens ,

And made a south wind blow by his power .
6 For that reason my people will know my name ;
31 I rejoiced over his habitable earth ,
12 I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord , who imparted power to me , because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry , 13 although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man . Nevertheless , I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith . 14 But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and the love that is in Christ Jesus . 15 This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners . Of these , I am foremost . 16 Nevertheless , I was shown mercy so that by means of me as the foremost case , Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his patience , making me an example to those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life .

11 Unitedly worshiping Jehovah draws us closer to him and enables us to enjoy refreshing association with fellow believers . Psalm 133 :1 says : “ Look ! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity ! ” How refreshing it is to get away from the world with all its selfishness , immorality , and violence and to congregate with those who truly love Jehovah and obey his laws !
5 While entire nations are not presenting themselves at Jehovah ’ s spiritual house for worship , millions of individuals out of all nations are doing so . As they learn about the loving purpose and the appealing personality of Jehovah God , their hearts are deeply moved . They humbly seek to find out what God requires of them . Their prayer is like that of the psalmist who said : “ Teach me to do your will , for you are my God . ” —Psalm 143 :10 .

2 The second greatest commandment , Jesus said , is linked to the first : “ You must love your neighbor as yourself . ” ( Matthew 22 :39 ) It is to this commandment that we now give attention , and for good reason . The times in which we live are marked by a selfish , distorted form of love . In his inspired description of “ the last days , ” the apostle Paul wrote that people would love , not one another , but themselves , money , and pleasures . Many would have “ no natural affection , ” or as one Bible translation puts it , they would “ lack normal affection for their families . ” ( 2 Timothy 3 :1-4 ) Jesus Christ foretold : “ Many . . . will betray one another and will hate one another . . . . The love of the greater number will cool off . ” —Matthew 24 :10 , 12 .

2 Special Metropolitan Public Witnessing : As reported in the 2013 Yearbook on pages 16 and 17 , a trial initiative for public witnessing began in New York City in November 2011 . Tables and carts with attractive displays and literature in several languages were strategically placed in areas of the city with high pedestrian traffic . Each day thousands of people walked by , including many who live in secured apartment buildings and persons who are often away from home . The response was overwhelming . In just one recent month , 3 ,797 magazines and 7 ,986 books were placed . Many passersby requested a Bible study . Since the emphasis was on starting Bible studies , any addresses left by interested ones were immediately forwarded to the appropriate congregation to follow up on the interest .

Faced with these conflicting views , they turn to the man who now can see and ask : “ What do you say about him , since it was your eyes that he opened ? ” He has no doubts about Jesus and responds : “ He is a prophet . ” —John 9 :17 .

12 Jehovah created the family and gave each family member a role . When each member understands what Jehovah expects of him or her , the family arrangement will work well and the whole family will benefit . ( 1 Corinthians 14 :33 ) Jehovah has made the husband the head of the family . This means that Jehovah expects him to take care of and lovingly guide his wife and children . So a husband must answer to Jehovah for how he cares for them . A Christian husband is kind and loving and treats his family the way Jesus treats the congregation . When a husband does this , he shows that he respects Jehovah .—Ephesians 5 :23 ; see Endnote 13 .

10 There are various ways a person could cause pain to his or her mate . We know that Christians should never hit their mates or do anything to harm them physically . Yet , we might hurt one another with our words . Words can become weapons . One woman said : “ My husband strikes me with words . I may not have visible bruises , but his constant cutting remarks , such as ‘ You ’ re a burden ! ’ and ‘ You ’ re worthless ! ’ have scarred my heart . ” One husband said that his wife constantly put him down with her words and called him names . He said : “ I can ’ t repeat in polite company the things she says to me . That ’ s why I can ’ t talk to her and why I stay at work so late . It ’ s a lot safer than coming home . ” Abusive speech , saying cruel and unkind things that cause emotional pain , is common today .

3 This statement is trustworthy : If a man is reaching out to be an overseer , he is desirous of a fine work . 2 The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible , a husband of one wife , moderate in habits , sound in mind , orderly , hospitable , qualified to teach , 3 not a drunkard , not violent , but reasonable , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money , 4 a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner , having his children in subjection with all seriousness 5 ( for if any man does not know how to preside over his own household , how will he care for the congregation of God ? ) , 6 not a newly converted man , for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed on the Devil . 7 Moreover , he should also have a fine testimony from outsiders so that he does not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil .

19 Pilate then took Jesus and scourged him . 2 And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and clothed him with a purple robe , 3 and they kept coming up to him and saying : “ Greetings , you King of the Jews ! ” They also kept slapping him in the face . 4 Pilate went outside again and said to them : “ See ! I bring him outside to you in order for you to know that I find no fault in him . ” 5 So Jesus came outside , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . And Pilate said to them : “ Look ! The man ! ” 6 However , when the chief priests and the officers saw him , they shouted : “ To the stake with him ! To the stake with him ! ” Pilate said to them : “ Take him yourselves and execute him , for I do not find any fault in him . ” 7 The Jews answered him : “ We have a law , and according to the law he ought to die , because he made himself God ’ s son . ”

Some scholars continue to hold that the Jesus of history was an eschatological Jewish prophet calling for repentance . However , they stop short of calling him Son of God , Messiah , and Redeemer . Most question the Biblical account of his heavenly origin and his resurrection . To others , Jesus was just a man who through his exemplary life and teachings inspired several faiths that eventually were enveloped into Christianity . And as noted in Theology Today , still others see Jesus as “ a cynic , a wandering sage , or a peasant mystic ; a community organizer , a hippie poet jabbing at the establishment , or a street smart provocateur who raps his way through the seething , impoverished , socially volatile villages of backwater Palestine . ”

5 Everything we do in life is connected to our worship of Jehovah . Paul explained this when he said : “ Present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God . ” ( Romans 12 :1 ) Jesus said : “ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength . ” ( Mark 12 :30 ) We always want to give Jehovah our best . In ancient Israel , when people sacrificed an animal to Jehovah , they were expected to give a healthy animal . If the sacrifice had something wrong with it , God did not accept it . ( Leviticus 22 :18-20 ) In a similar way , our worship could become unacceptable to Jehovah . How ?

44 At this Saul said : “ Thus may God do and may he add to it if you do not die , Jonʹa·than . ” 45 But the people said to Saul : “ Should Jonʹa·than die—the one who brought this great victory to Israel ? It is unthinkable ! As surely as Jehovah is alive , not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground , for it was with God that he acted this day . ” With that the people rescued Jonʹa·than , and he did not die .

6 At Psalm 101 :3 , we find David ’ s words : “ I shall not set in front of my eyes any good-for-nothing thing . ” There are many opportunities today to set in front of our eyes good-for-nothing things , particularly when we are alone . Access to the Internet has presented many with a challenge in this regard . It is easy to be lured into looking at suggestive , even pornographic , material . But is doing so an act of obedience to the God who inspired David to pen those words ? Pornography is harmful , for it inflames wrong and greedy desires , damages the conscience , erodes marriages , and degrades everyone involved .—Prov . 4 :23 ; 2 Cor . 7 :1 ; 1 Thess . 4 :3-5 .

20 No balanced Christian would use such evidence of God ’ s love and esteem as an excuse for pride or egotism . The apostle Paul wrote : “ Through the undeserved kindness given to me I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think ; but to think so as to have a sound mind , each one as God has distributed to him a measure of faith . ” ( Romans 12 :3 ) Another translation says here : “ I would say to every one of you not to estimate himself above his real value , but to make a sober rating of himself . ” ( A Translation in the Language of the People , by Charles B . Williams ) So while we bask in the warmth of our heavenly Father ’ s love , let us be sound in mind and remember that we neither earn nor deserve God ’ s love .—Luke 17 :10 .

6 Read Luke 4 :43 . Jesus preached “ the good news of the Kingdom , ” and he expects his disciples to do the same . What group of people are preaching that message in “ all the nations ” ? The answer is obvious—only Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . Even some opposers acknowledge this fact . For example , a missionary priest once told a Witness that he had lived in many different countries and that he had asked the Witnesses in each country what message they were preaching . What answer was he given ? The priest said : “ They were all so stupid that they gave the same answer : ‘ The good news of the Kingdom . ’ ” Far from being “ stupid , ” however , those Witnesses were speaking in unity , as true Christians should . ( 1 Cor . 1 :10 ) And they were echoing the message contained in The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah ’ s Kingdom . This magazine is available in 254 languages , and an average of nearly 59 million copies of each issue are produced , making it the most widely circulated magazine in the world .

Repeatedly , Jehovah urged his people to “ make a distinction ” between what is clean and what is unclean . ( Lev . 10 :9-11 ) He said that those who would serve in his great spiritual temple would instruct people “ in the difference between a holy thing and a profane thing . ” ( Ezek . 44 :23 ) The book of Proverbs is full of contrasts between righteousness and wickedness , between wisdom and foolishness . Even things that are not opposites can be distinguished from one another . The apostle Paul drew a contrast between a righteous man and a good man , as recorded at Romans 5 :7 . In the book of Hebrews , he showed the superiority of Christ ’ s high-priestly service over that of Aaron . Indeed , as 17th-century educator John Amos Comenius wrote : “ To teach means scarcely anything more than to show how things differ from one another in their different purposes , forms , and origins . . . . Therefore , he who differentiates well teaches well . ”
17 To his anointed brothers , Paul wrote : “ Beloved ones , let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in God ’ s fear . ” ( 2 Corinthians 7 :1 ) This statement shows that anointed Christians , “ partakers of the heavenly calling , ” must put forth constant effort to prove that they reflect Jehovah ’ s view of holiness in every aspect of their lives . ( Hebrews 3 :1 ) Similarly , the apostle Peter exhorted his spirit-begotten brothers : “ As obedient children , quit being fashioned according to the desires you formerly had in your ignorance , but , in accord with the Holy One who called you , do you also become holy yourselves in all your conduct . ” —1 Peter 1 :14 , 15 .

15 Especially in the Western world , occultism , witchcraft , and other forms of spiritism are taken more and more lightly . Movies , books , TV programs , and computer games increasingly portray demonistic practices as being fun , smart , and harmless . Some movies and books with plots focusing on the occult have become so wildly popular that devotees have organized fan clubs . Clearly , the demons have succeeded in trivializing the dangers of the occult . Has this trend of taking spiritism lightly influenced Christians ? The thinking of some has been affected . In what way ? To give a typical example , after one Christian watched a movie that centered on the occult , he said , “ I saw the movie , but I didn ’ t practice spiritism . ” Why is such reasoning dangerous ?

17 When we base our decisions on Jehovah ’ s thinking , we draw closer to him . ( Jas . 4 :8 ) We enjoy his approval and blessing . This , in turn , strengthens our faith in our heavenly Father . Therefore , let us be guided by Bible laws and principles , for they reveal God ’ s mind on matters . Of course , we will always have something new to learn about Jehovah . ( Job 26 :14 ) With diligent effort , however , we can even now acquire the wisdom , knowledge , and discernment needed to make wise decisions . ( Prov . 2 :1-5 ) The ideas and plans of imperfect humans come and go , but the psalmist fittingly reminds us : “ The decisions of Jehovah will stand forever ; the thoughts of his heart are from generation to generation . ” ( Ps . 33 :11 ) Clearly , we can make the best personal decisions when our thoughts and actions are in harmony with the thinking of our all-wise God , Jehovah .

8 The Bible also contains many good examples of people who were honest : Jacob , who urged his sons to return the money they had found ; Jephthah and his daughter , who kept a promise to God ; and Jesus , who was honest even in difficult situations . ( Genesis 43 :12 ; Judges 11 :30-40 ; John 18 :3-11 ) These examples can help children to understand the value of honesty .
One Saturday evening when I was five years old , I was with my father , offering the Watchtower and Consolation ( now Awake ! ) magazines to passersby on the street . At the time , the country was embroiled in World War II . An intoxicated doctor came by and verbally abused Father because of his Christian neutrality , saying that he was a coward and a draft dodger . The doctor put his face right up in front of Father ’ s and said , “ Why don ’ t you hit me , you yellow coward ! ” I was frightened but so admired Father . He just kept on offering the magazines to the crowd that had gathered . Then a soldier walked by , and the doctor yelled , “ Do something about this yellow coward ! ” The soldier could see that the man was drunk , so he told him , “ Go home and sober up ! ” They both left . I look back with appreciation for the courage that Jehovah gave my father . He owned two barbershops in Wichita , and the doctor was one of his clients !

9 Many take for granted the sheer generosity that is heaped upon mankind because of the continued action of the sun , the rain , and the fruitful seasons . For example , consider the apple . Throughout the temperate regions of the earth , it is a common fruit . Yet , it is beautiful , delicious to eat , and full of refreshing water and vital nutrients . Did you know that worldwide there are some 7 ,500 different varieties of apples , ranging in color from red to gold to yellow to green and in size from slightly larger than a cherry to the size of a grapefruit ? If you hold a tiny apple seed in your hand , it looks insignificant . But from it grows one of the loveliest of trees . ( Song of Solomon 2 :3 ) Every spring the apple tree is crowned with a glorious halo of blossoms ; every autumn it produces fruit . Each year—for up to 75 years—the average apple tree will yield enough fruit to fill 20 cartons to a weight of 42 pounds ( 19 kg ) each !
114 When Israel went out of Egypt ,
18 Perhaps the most dramatic revelation of all came on the night before Jesus ’ death when he told his faithful disciples about “ the new covenant . ” ( Luke 22 :20 ) Like its predecessor , the Mosaic Law covenant , this new covenant was to produce “ a kingdom of priests . ” ( Exodus 19 :6 ; 1 Peter 2 :9 ) However , this covenant would establish , not a fleshly nation , but a spiritual one , “ the Israel of God , ” made up exclusively of Christ ’ s faithful anointed followers . ( Galatians 6 :16 ) These parties to the new covenant would share with Jesus in blessing the human race !

8 However , subjection to political rulers is to be relative , not unlimited . When there is a conflict between Jehovah ’ s laws and man ’ s laws , those who serve Jehovah are to obey His laws . Notice what the book On the Road to Civilization—A World History says of the early Christians : “ Christians refused to share certain duties of Roman citizens . The Christians . . . felt it a violation of their faith to enter military service . They would not hold political office . They would not worship the emperor . ” When the Jewish high court “ positively ordered ” the disciples to stop preaching , they answered : “ We must obey God as ruler rather than men . ” —Acts 5 :27-29 .

PICTURE three scenarios : A boy is facing some of his schoolmates . They are trying to provoke him into losing his temper , perhaps to curse or to fight . Will he retaliate , or will he restrain himself and walk away ? A husband at home alone is doing some research on the Internet . A box appears on his computer screen , advertising a lewd Web site . Will he be tempted and go to that site , or will he make sure that he avoids it ? A Christian woman is conversing with a small group when the talk turns negative , becoming hurtful gossip about a sister in the congregation . Will she share in that , or will she try to change the subject ?
That does not , though , apply to all who are hearing Jesus . He explains : “ Happy are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear . For truly I say to you , many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them , and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them . ” —Matthew 13 :16 , 17 .
Both of them will go up in flames together ,
Jesus repeats a statement he has already made : “ I am going away , and you will look for me , and yet you will die in your sin . Where I am going , you can not come . ” The Jews , completely misunderstanding Jesus ’ words , begin to wonder : “ He will not kill himself , will he ? Because he says , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come . ’ ” They do not understand what Jesus means , because they are unaware of his origin . He explains : “ You are from the realms below ; I am from the realms above . You are from this world ; I am not from this world . ” —John 8 :21-23 .

7 Then Jehovah said to Satan : “ Where have you come from ? ” Satan answered Jehovah : “ From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it . ” 8 And Jehovah said to Satan : “ Have you taken note of my servant Job ? There is no one like him on the earth . He is an upright man of integrity , fearing God and shunning what is bad . ” 9 At that Satan answered Jehovah : “ Is it for nothing that Job has feared God ? 10 Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has ? You have blessed the work of his hands , and his livestock has spread out in the land . 11 But , for a change , stretch out your hand and strike everything he has , and he will surely curse you to your very face . ” 12 Then Jehovah said to Satan : “ Look ! Everything that he has is in your hand . Only do not lay your hand on the man himself ! ” So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah .

Hence , Paul reminds us of the need to pray to Jehovah “ on every occasion in spirit . ” At the same time , we should listen to Jehovah by studying his Word and associating with fellow “ soldiers ” at every opportunity , for we are not in this fight alone ! ( Philemon 2 ; Hebrews 10 :24 , 25 ) Those who are faithful in all these areas will not only come off victorious but will also be able to make a strong defense for their faith when it is challenged .

The ability to read influences how much a young person gets from his schooling . When he seeks employment , his reading ability may influence the kind of work that he is able to get and the number of hours that he has to work in order to make a living . Housewives who read well are better able to care for their families with regard to proper nutrition , hygiene , and prevention of sickness . Mothers who are good readers may also exercise a very positive influence on the intellectual development of their children .

15 We who are Jews by birth , and not sinners from the nations , 16 recognize that a man is declared righteous , not by works of law , but only through faith in Jesus Christ . So we have put our faith in Christ Jesus , so that we may be declared righteous by faith in Christ and not by works of law , for no one will be declared righteous by works of law . 17 Now if we have also been found sinners while seeking to be declared righteous by means of Christ , is Christ then sin ’ s minister ? Certainly not ! 18 If the very things that I once tore down I build up again , I demonstrate that I am a transgressor . 19 For through law I died toward law , so that I might become alive toward God . 20 I am nailed to the stake along with Christ . It is no longer I who live , but it is Christ who is living in union with me . Indeed , the life that I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and handed himself over for me . 21 I do not reject the undeserved kindness of God , for if righteousness is through law , Christ actually died for nothing .

Personality trait
Paul was very much aware that he had neither earned nor deserved God ’ s great mercy , having been a former persecutor of Christians . Toward the end of his life , Paul wrote to his fellow worker Timothy : “ I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord , who imparted power to me , because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry . ” ( 1 Tim . 1 :12-14 ) What was that ministry ? Paul told the elders of the congregation in Ephesus what it included , stating : “ I do not consider my own life of any importance to me , if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus , to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God . ” ( Acts 20 :24 ) In his zeal to perform his ministry , Paul set an excellent example for modern-day Christians and demonstrated that God ’ s undeserved kindness had not been shown to him “ in vain . ” w16 .07 4 :1-3
15 “ Love is not jealous . ” Improper jealousy can cause us to become envious of what others have—their belongings , blessings , or abilities . Such jealousy is a selfish , destructive emotion that , left unchecked , can disrupt the peace of the congregation . What will help us to resist the “ tendency to envy ” ? ( James 4 :5 ) In a word , love . This precious quality can enable us to rejoice with those who seem to have certain advantages in life that we ourselves do not have . ( Romans 12 :15 ) Love helps us not to view it as a personal affront when someone receives praise for some exceptional ability or outstanding achievement .
12 O Jehovah , you will grant us peace ,
17 Serving shoulder to shoulder with our brothers and sisters promotes unity . It also builds lasting friendships and increases mutual confidence in the coming blessings under God ’ s Kingdom . As we strengthen the hands of others , we help them to battle discouraging circumstances and to maintain a positive and hopeful view of the future . Moreover , doing that for others helps us to keep our spiritual focus and to feel the reality of what God has in store for us . Yes , it strengthens our hands too .

8 Satan claimed that Job served God for selfish reasons . Satan said to Jehovah : “ Have you not put up a protective hedge [ or , fence ] around him and his house and everything he has ? You have blessed the work of his hands , and his livestock has spread out in the land . But , for a change , stretch out your hand and strike everything he has , and he will surely curse you to your very face . ” —Job 1 :10 , 11 .
But can we really have confidence in the Gospels ’ version of Jesus ? Do they portray the real Jesus ? The late Frederick F . Bruce , professor of Biblical criticism and exegesis at the University of Manchester , England , stated : “ It is not usually possible to demonstrate by historical arguments the truth of every detail in an ancient writing , whether inside or outside the Bible . It is sufficient to have reasonable confidence in a writer ’ s general trustworthiness ; if that is established , there is an a priori likelihood that his details are true . . . . The New Testament is not less likely to be historically reliable because Christians receive it as ‘ sacred ’ literature . ”

10 He wrote it in the name of King A·has·u·eʹrus and sealed it with the king ’ s signet ring and sent the written documents by the hand of couriers on horses ; they rode on swift post-horses , bred for royal service . 11 In these documents the king granted permission to the Jews in all the different cities to gather together and defend their lives and to annihilate , kill , and destroy any forces of any people or province that might attack them , including women and children , and to seize their possessions . 12 This was to occur on the same day in all the provinces of King A·has·u·eʹrus , on the 13th day of the 12th month , that is , the month of Aʹdar . 13 The text of the document was to be issued as law throughout all the provinces . It was to be proclaimed to all the peoples , so that the Jews would be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies . 14 The couriers riding the post-horses used in the royal service went out urgently and speedily at the king ’ s order .

The Italian Peninsula was named Italia and was not a province , but the territory of the city of Rome , thus having a special status .[44] The long and triumphant reign of the first emperor , Augustus , began a golden age of peace and prosperity .

22 Like any loving parent , Jehovah may offer forgiveness along with a measure of discipline . ( Proverbs 3 :11 , 12 ) A repentant Christian may have to relinquish his privilege of serving as an elder , a ministerial servant , or a full-time evangelizer . It may be painful for him to lose for a period of time privileges that were precious to him . Such discipline , however , does not mean that Jehovah has withheld forgiveness . We must remember that discipline from Jehovah is proof of his love for us . Accepting and applying it is in our best interests .—Hebrews 12 :5-11 .

13 Be a good listener . ( Jas . 1 :19 ) To listen with empathy is an act of love . You may ask tactful and sympathetic questions with the aim of understanding the feelings of a sufferer . You will then be able to show empathy and to build up your fellow servant . Let your facial expressions reflect your sincere , loving concern . If the other Christian feels the need to explain things in greater detail , be patient and resist any urge to interrupt . By listening patiently , you will more likely understand the feelings involved . That can help your suffering brother or sister to have confidence in you and thus be more inclined to listen to what you say as you strive to be upbuilding . When you show that you truly care , your loving concern can be very comforting .
I 'm not going to minimize those concerns .

They were unable to solve the riddle for three days . 15 On the fourth day , they said to Samson ’ s wife : “ Trick your husband so that he will tell us the answer to the riddle . Otherwise , we will burn you and your father ’ s house with fire . Did you invite us here to take our possessions ? ” 16 So Samson ’ s wife wept over him and said : “ You must hate me ; you do not love me . You told a riddle to my people , but you have not told the answer to me . ” At this he said to her : “ Why , I have not told it even to my own father and mother ! Should I tell it to you ? ” 17 But she kept weeping over him the rest of the seven-day banquet . He finally told her on the seventh day , because she had pressured him . Then she told her people the answer to the riddle . 18 So on the seventh day before the sun set , the men of the city said to him :

I will build them up , and I will not tear down ; I will plant them , and I will not uproot . 7 And I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Jehovah . They will become my people , and I will become their God , for they will return to me with all their heart .

He made water flow out of the flinty rock 16 and fed you with manna in the wilderness , which your fathers had not known , in order to humble you and to put you to the test so as to benefit you in the future . 17 If you should say in your heart , ‘ My own power and the strength of my own hand have produced this wealth for me , ’ 18 remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power to you to make wealth , in order to carry out his covenant that he swore to your forefathers , as it is today .

16 After the abyssing of Satan and his demons , Jesus Christ and his 144 ,000 joint heirs will rule as kings and priests for the thousand years . ( Revelation 20 :6 ) During that period , mankind will be brought to perfection , with sin and Adamic death forever eliminated . At the end of the Thousand Year Reign , having successfully carried out his assignment as Messianic King-Priest , Jesus “ hands over the kingdom ” to his Father , “ that God may be all things to everyone . ” ( 1 Corinthians 15 :24-28 ) At that point , Satan is released for a little while to test redeemed humankind as to their support of Jehovah ’ s universal sovereignty . After that final test is complete , Jehovah will destroy Satan and the rebels who sided with him . ( Revelation 20 :7-10 ) Those who upheld Jehovah ’ s sovereignty—his right to rule—will have fully demonstrated their unswerving loyalty . They will then be brought into their proper relationship with Jehovah , being accepted by him as his sons and daughters , divinely approved for everlasting life .—Romans 8 :21 .

5 Presumptuous acts are more serious than innocent mistakes . First , when we act immodestly , we fail to honor Jehovah as our rightful Sovereign . Second , if we act beyond the scope of our authority , we are likely to get into conflict with others . ( Prov . 13 :10 ) And third , when it becomes clear that we have acted presumptuously , we may be embarrassed or even humiliated . ( Luke 14 :8 , 9 ) Presumptuous acts do not turn out well . As the Scriptures show , modesty is always the right course .

We win people ’ s hearts , not by boasting or drawing undue attention to ourselves , but by displaying a “ quiet and mild spirit . ” ( 1 Pet . 3 :3 , 4 ; Jer . 9 :23 , 24 ) Vain sentiments in our hearts will eventually show up in our actions . We might drop hints , for example , implying that we enjoy special privileges , possess inside information , or have special relationships with responsible brothers . Or we might explain things in such a way that only we get the credit for ideas or accomplishments that others also contributed to . Jesus set a wonderful example . A good portion of what he said was either a quotation from or an allusion to the Hebrew Scriptures . He modestly spoke that way so that his hearers would know that what he said was coming from Jehovah and was not the product of his own intellect or wisdom . w17 .01 4 :12

35 Now as Jesus was getting near to Jerʹi·cho , a blind man was sitting beside the road begging . 36 Because he heard a crowd passing by , he began to inquire what was going on . 37 They reported to him : “ Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ is passing by ! ” 38 At that he cried out : “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ” 39 And those who were in front began rebuking him , telling him to keep quiet , but all the more he kept shouting : “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ” 40 Then Jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him . After he came near , Jesus asked him : 41 “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He said : “ Lord , let me recover my sight . ” 42 So Jesus said to him : “ Recover your sight ; your faith has made you well . ” 43 And instantly he recovered his sight , and he began to follow him , glorifying God . Also , at seeing it , all the people gave praise to God .

In 1932 , Volume 2 of the book Vindication first showed that the Bible prophecies focusing on the restoration of God ’ s people to their homeland saw a modern-day fulfillment , not on fleshly Israel , but on spiritual Israel . Those prophecies point to the restoration of pure worship . The Watchtower of March 1 , 1999 , explained that Ezekiel ’ s temple vision is such a restoration prophecy and therefore has an important spiritual fulfillment during the last days .

17 Jesus spoke these things , and raising his eyes to heaven , he said : “ Father , the hour has come . Glorify your son so that your son may glorify you , 2 just as you have given him authority over all flesh , so that he may give everlasting life to all those whom you have given to him . 3 This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . 4 I have glorified you on the earth , having finished the work you have given me to do . 5 So now , Father , glorify me at your side with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was .
Like his father , Asa , Jehoshaphat encouraged the people to search for Jehovah . He did so by organizing a teaching campaign that used “ the book of Jehovah ’ s Law . ” ( 2 Chron . 17 :7-10 ) He even went to the territory of the northern kingdom of Israel , to the mountainous region of Ephraim , “ to bring them back to Jehovah . ” ( 2 Chron . 19 :4 ) We can all have a share in the great teaching campaign that Jehovah is having done today . Is it your goal each month to teach the Word of God to others , trying to move their heart to serve God ? By your extending yourself and with God ’ s blessing , you may be able to start a Bible study . Is that a goal that you pray about ? Are you willing to accept this challenge , even giving up some of what is commonly viewed as free time ? And just as Jehoshaphat went to the territory of Ephraim to help people return to true worship , we can reach out to those who have become inactive . w17 .03 3 :10 , 11

6 Do you let older ones know that you cherish them as Jehovah cherishes them ? One way you can do so is by telling them how much you love them for their faithfulness and how you value their opinions . Moreover , by acting on what you learn from them , you demonstrate that your respect for them is sincere . Many elderly Christians can recall the wise advice they received from faithful older ones and how acting on it has benefited them throughout their lives .

4 First , the Bible directly teaches that God sees worth in each of his servants . For example , Jesus said : “ Do not two sparrows sell for a coin of small value ? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father ’ s knowledge . But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Therefore have no fear : you are worth more than many sparrows . ” ( Matthew 10 :29-31 ) Consider what those words meant to Jesus ’ first-century listeners .

Brother Harteva , who was born in 1882 , was one of the first Bible Students in Finland . He was baptized in April 1910 , and in the summer of 1912 , Brother Russell authorized him to publish The Watch Tower in Finnish . All went well until World War I broke out . Brother Harteva wrote in the December 1 , 1914 , issue of The Watch Tower : “ Because of the difficult economic situation , . . . we can not promise that The Watch Tower will have the same number of pages or will be published as often this year . ” However , in 1915 , to raise funds , Brother Harteva and others founded a cooperative association called Ararat , which began to publish a magazine by that name .

8 Consider first the family circle . “ A husband is head of his wife , ” says Ephesians 5 :23 . How is a husband to exercise this God-given authority ? The Bible tells husbands to dwell with their wives “ according to knowledge , assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel . ” ( 1 Peter 3 :7 ) The Greek noun rendered “ honor ” means “ price , value , . . . respect . ” Forms of this word are translated “ gifts ” and “ precious . ” ( Acts 28 :10 ; 1 Peter 2 :7 ) A husband who honors his wife would never assault her physically ; neither would he humiliate or disparage her , causing her to feel worthless . Rather , he recognizes her value and treats her with respect . He shows by his words and deeds—in private and in public—that she is precious to him . ( Proverbs 31 :28 ) Such a husband gains not only his wife ’ s love and respect but , more important , God ’ s approval .

But you are a God ready to forgive , compassionate and merciful , slow to anger and abundant in loyal love , and you did not abandon them . 18 Even when they made for themselves a metal statue of a calf and were saying , ‘ This is your God who led you up out of Egypt , ’ and they committed great acts of disrespect , 19 even then you , in your great mercy , did not abandon them in the wilderness . The pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way , nor the pillar of fire by night to light up for them the way they should go . 20 And you gave your good spirit to give them insight , and you did not hold back your manna from their mouth , and you gave them water when they were thirsty . 21 For 40 years you provided them with food in the wilderness . They lacked nothing . Their garments did not wear out , and their feet did not become swollen .

10 When wisdom enters your heart
9 Consider , for example , an outstanding event in the life of Abraham . Abraham had three visitors , one of whom he addressed as “ Jehovah . ” The visitors were actually angels , but one of them came in Jehovah ’ s name and was acting in His name . When that angel spoke and acted , it was , in effect , Jehovah speaking and acting . By this means , Jehovah told Abraham that He had heard a loud “ cry of complaint about Sodom and Gomorrah . ” Jehovah stated : “ I am quite determined to go down that I may see whether they act altogether according to the outcry over it that has come to me , and , if not , I can get to know it . ” ( Genesis 18 :3 , 20 , 21 ) Of course , Jehovah ’ s message did not mean that the Almighty would “ go down ” in person . Rather , he again sent angels to represent him . ( Genesis 19 :1 ) Why ? Could the all-seeing Jehovah not “ get to know ” the true condition of that region on his own ? Certainly . But instead , Jehovah humbly gave those angels the assignment to investigate the situation and to visit Lot and his family in Sodom .

11 To Pilate , Jesus did say : “ For this I have been born , and for this I have come into the world , that I should bear witness to the truth . ” ( John 18 :37 ) Jehovah had commissioned Jesus to preach the good news , and Jesus delighted to do so because he loved his heavenly Father . ( Luke 4 :18 , 19 ) Jesus also had love for the people . He knew their lives were difficult . Likewise , our bold and fearless witnessing is deeply rooted in love of God and love of neighbor .—Matt . 22 :36-40 .
45 “ All these curses will certainly come upon you and pursue you and overtake you until you have been annihilated , because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God by keeping his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you . 46 And they will continue on you and your offspring as a permanent sign and portent , 47 because you did not serve Jehovah your God with rejoicing and joy of heart when you had such an abundance of everything . 48 Jehovah will send your enemies against you , and you will serve them while you are hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and lacking everything . He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has annihilated you .

There , on June 20 , 1948 , Father baptized me in a mountain stream , along with others who had accepted Bible truths , including Billie Nichols and his wife . They later went into the circuit work , as did their son and his wife .

6 And during all this time I was not in Jerusalem , for I went to the king in the 32nd year of King Ar·ta·xerxʹes of Babylon ; and sometime later I asked the king for a leave of absence . 7 Then I came to Jerusalem and noticed the terrible thing that E·liʹa·shib had done in behalf of To·biʹah , making a storeroom available for him in the courtyard of the house of the true God . 8 This was very displeasing to me , so I threw all of To·biʹah ’ s household furniture out of the storeroom . 9 After that I gave orders , and they cleansed the storerooms ; and I put back there the utensils of the house of the true God , with the grain offering and the frankincense .

“ WOMAN . ” That is the way Jesus sometimes addressed individuals of the opposite sex . For example , when healing a disabled person who had been bent double for 18 years , he said : “ Woman , you are released from your weakness . ” ( Luke 13 :10-13 ) Jesus even used this customary form of address , which was considered polite in Bible times , when speaking to his own mother . ( John 19 :26 ; 20 :13 ) But there was another word that was more than polite .

Do not turn me away . ” So the king said to her : “ Make it , my mother ; for I will not turn you away . ” 21 She said : “ Let Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite be given as a wife to your brother Ad·o·niʹjah . ” 22 At this King Solʹo·mon answered his mother : “ Why are you requesting Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite for Ad·o·niʹjah ? You may as well request the kingship for him , for he is my older brother , and supporting him are A·biʹa·thar the priest and Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah . ”

With keen interest , then , let us give attention to the book of Joshua .—Hebrews 4 :12 .
17 Some decisions are weightier than others . The weightier ones call for more thought and prayerful consideration , which may take time . Some Christians face decisions about whether to marry and whom to marry . Another serious decision that holds the potential for many blessings is how and when to enter the full-time ministry . In such areas , it is important to have full trust that Jehovah can and does provide wise guidance . ( Prov . 1 :5 ) Thus , it is vital to draw on the Bible as the best source of advice and to seek Jehovah ’ s guidance in prayer . And bear in mind that Jehovah can give us the qualities we need to make decisions that are in harmony with his will . When facing important decisions , make it a practice to ask : ‘ Will this decision give evidence of my love for Jehovah ? Will it bring joy and peace to my family ? And will it show that I am patient and kind ? ’

13 The Jews were in a position to know the truth about the dead . When Greece was divided among the generals of Alexander the Great , however , efforts were made to unite Judah with Syria by such means as Greek religion and Hellenic culture . As a result , the Jews accepted the false teachings that the human soul is immortal and that there is an underworld place of torment . The Greeks did not originate the idea of an underworld full of suffering souls , for the Babylonians thought of “ the nether world . . . as a place full of horrors , . . . presided over by gods and demons of great strength and fierceness . ” ( The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria ) Yes , the Babylonians believed in the immortality of the soul .

At Pentecost 33 C .E . , thousands of Jews and proselytes were anointed with holy spirit . These new Christians became “ a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for special possession . ” ( 1 Pet . 2 :9 , 10 ) The apostles kept careful watch over the congregations of God ’ s people as long as they lived . However , especially after the death of the apostles , men arose who spoke “ twisted things ” in order to “ draw away the disciples after themselves . ” ( 2 Thess . 2 :6-8 ) Many of these men had responsible positions in the congregations , serving as overseers and later as “ bishops . ” A clergy class was taking shape , although Jesus had said to his followers : “ All of you are brothers . ” ( Matt . 23 :8 ) Prominent men who were enamored of the philosophies of Aristotle and Plato introduced false religious ideas , gradually replacing the pure teachings of God ’ s Word . w16 .11 4 :8

7 Once our faith is established , we must continue to nourish it . Our faith might be compared to a wood fire . When the fire is started , it may come roaring to life in an intense blaze . However , if nothing more is done to the fire , it will eventually die down to hot coals that , in turn , will become cold ashes if left alone . But if you regularly feed the fire with more wood , it can be kept going indefinitely . So , too , our faith can be kept alive if we regularly feed on God ’ s Word . By progressively studying the Bible , we can develop a deep love for it and its Author , and that will become the basis for building more faith .
Meditation takes many forms , a number of which have roots in ancient Eastern religions . “ The mind has to be empty to see clearly , ” said one writer on the subject . His words reflect the view that emptying the mind while focusing on certain words or images promotes inner peace , mental clarity , and spiritual enlightenment .
66 Now while Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the servant girls of the high priest came . 67 On seeing Peter warming himself , she looked straight at him and said : “ You too were with the Naz·a·reneʹ , this Jesus . ” 68 But he denied it , saying : “ Neither do I know him nor do I understand what you are talking about , ” and he went outside to the entryway . 69 There the servant girl saw him and again began to say to those standing by : “ This is one of them . ” 70 Again he was denying it . And after a little while , those standing by again began saying to Peter : “ Certainly you are one of them , for you are , in fact , a Gal·i·leʹan . ” 71 But he started to curse and swear : “ I do not know this man of whom you speak ! ” 72 Immediately a rooster crowed a second time , and Peter recalled what Jesus had said to him : “ Before a rooster crows twice , you will disown me three times . ” And he broke down and began to weep .
18 Obeying the new commandment to love one another is not an easy course to follow , but we have a powerful motivation for doing so . Paul wrote : “ The love the Christ has compels us , because this is what we have judged , that one man died for all . . . , and he died for all that those who live might live no longer for themselves , but for him who died for them and was raised up . ” ( 2 Corinthians 5 :14 , 15 ) Since Jesus died for us , should we not feel compelled to live for him ? We can do that by following his example of self-sacrificing love .
10 . Why is Jehovah the only reliable Source of deliverance ?
16 For this is what Jehovah said to me : “ Within one year , like the years of a hired worker , all the glory of Keʹdar will come to an end . 17 The remaining bowmen of the warriors of Keʹdar will be few , for Jehovah the God of Israel has spoken . ”
May there be peace upon Israel .
8 Like his Father , Jesus was compassionate . The Scriptures describe Jesus as one who reached out to those in distress because he was deeply moved . To describe the compassion of Jesus , the Bible uses a Greek word that is rendered “ moved with pity . ” Says one scholar : “ It describes . . . an emotion which moves a man to the very depths of his being . It is the strongest word in Greek for the feeling of compassion . ” Consider some situations in which Jesus was moved by a deep compassion that compelled him to act .

12 Another way to become more familiar with Jehovah ’ s thinking is by paying close attention to Bible-based guidance from his organization . For example , the Watch Tower Publications Index and the Research Guide for Jehovah ’ s Witnesses are produced to help us learn about Jehovah ’ s thinking on numerous situations requiring that we make personal decisions . We also benefit greatly by listening carefully at Christian meetings and participating in them . Meditating on what is being taught will help us to discern more about Jehovah ’ s thinking and to make his thoughts our own . By making diligent use of Jehovah ’ s provisions for spiritual feeding , we will progressively become more familiar with his ways . As a result , we will be in a better position to make personal decisions that our loving God will bless .

“ Large shield of faith ”
21 “ ‘ I will call for a sword against him on all my mountains , ’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah . ‘ Every man ’ s sword will be against his own brother . 22 I will bring my judgment against him with pestilence and bloodshed ; and I will rain down a torrential downpour and hailstones and fire and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many peoples with him . 23 And I will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations ; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah . ’

11 As you continue to study the Bible , you will learn things that really touch your heart . Notice how two of Jesus ’ disciples felt as Jesus was explaining Bible prophecies to them . They said : “ Were not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road , as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us ? ” —Luke 24 :32 .
Eight of my siblings—four brothers and four sisters—eventually accepted the truth . My sister Rose pioneered until her death . She spent her final days encouraging everyone to pay attention to God ’ s Word , saying , “ I want to see you in the new world . ” My older brother Ted was at first a hellfire preacher . Every Sunday morning he preached on the radio , hammering away at his listeners , telling them that sinners would burn forever in the unquenchable fire of hell . Later , however , he became a faithful and zealous servant of Jehovah .
19 In our time , Jehovah ’ s people also endure with joy when they suffer in behalf of Jesus ’ name or when they face difficult trials . ( Read James 1 :2-4 . ) Like the apostles , we do not take delight in any kind of suffering . But if we maintain our integrity to God during trials , Jehovah can help us to endure with fortitude . For example , in August 1944 , authorities in a totalitarian regime sent Henryk Dornik and his brother to a concentration camp . However , the opposers acknowledged : “ It is impossible to persuade them to do anything . Their martyrdom brings them joy . ” Brother Dornik explained : “ Although I had no desire to be a martyr , suffering with courage and dignity for my loyalty to Jehovah did bring me joy . . . . Fervent prayers drew me closer to Jehovah , and he proved to be a reliable Helper . ”
8 Jehovah specifically commanded Adam and Eve to populate the earth and to take care of it . ( Gen . 1 :28 ) Did this command in some way deprive them of their freedom ? Of course not ! It was given to enable humans to participate in their Creator ’ s purpose—to make the earth into a global paradise home for a race of perfect humans forever . ( Isa . 45 :18 ) Today , it is not against Jehovah ’ s will for people to choose to be single or to be married but remain childless . Still , by and large , people marry and raise children in spite of the challenges such choices bring . ( 1 Cor . 7 :36-38 ) Why ? Because under normal circumstances , people find happiness and satisfaction in doing so . ( Ps . 127 :3 ) Enjoying their marriage and family for all eternity could have been Adam and Eve ’ s happy lot in life .

17 Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves . 2 And he was transfigured before them ; his face shone as the sun , and his outer garments became brilliant as the light . 3 And look ! there appeared to them Moses and E·liʹjah conversing with him . 4 Then Peter said to Jesus : “ Lord , it is fine for us to be here . If you wish , I will erect three tents here , one for you , one for Moses , and one for E·liʹjah . ” 5 While he was still speaking , look ! a bright cloud overshadowed them , and look ! a voice out of the cloud said : “ This is my Son , the beloved , whom I have approved . Listen to him . ” 6 At hearing this , the disciples fell facedown and became very much afraid . 7 Then Jesus came near , and touching them , he said : “ Get up . Have no fear . ” 8 When they looked up , they saw no one but Jesus himself . 9 As they were descending from the mountain , Jesus commanded them : “ Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead . ”
12 How can you be effective when you reason with others about creation and the Bible ? First , do not be quick to assume you know what others believe . Some people say that they believe in evolution , but they also feel that God exists . They think that God used evolution to create different forms of life . Others say that they believe in evolution because they feel that it would not be taught at school were it not a fact . And some stop believing in God because they are disappointed with religion . So when you discuss the origin of life with someone , it is usually wise to ask questions first . Find out what that person believes . If you are reasonable and willing to listen , he may be inclined to listen to you .—Titus 3 :2 .

You continued scattering your favors to strangers under every luxuriant tree , but you would not obey my voice , ” declares Jehovah . ’ ”

6 It is not easy for imperfect humans to pursue righteousness . We must strip off the old personality with its sinful practices and put on the new one . The Bible says that the new personality is “ being made new ” through accurate knowledge . ( Colossians 3 :9 , 10 ) The words “ being made new ” indicate that putting on the new personality is a continuing process , one that requires diligent effort . No matter how hard we try to do what is right , there are times when our sinful nature causes us to stumble in thought , word , or deed .—Romans 7 :14-20 ; James 3 :2 .

To honor someone means to show him special attention as well as respect . Reasonably , we would expect that a person who is worthy of such attention and respect has done something to merit honor or that he serves in a special position . So we might well ask , Whom should we honor , and why is such honor merited ? As Revelation 5 :13 indicates , “ the One sitting on the throne and . . . the Lamb ” surely deserve to be honored . We note in chapter 4 of the same Bible book one reason why Jehovah deserves to be honored . Exalted creatures in the heavenly realm lift their voices in praise to Jehovah , “ the One who lives forever and ever . ” They declare : “ You are worthy , Jehovah our God , to receive the glory and the honor and the power , because you created all things , and because of your will they came into existence and were created . ” —Rev . 4 :9-11 . w17 .03 1 :1 , 2

13 Many of God ’ s servants are in situations that involve personal suffering . Their suffering continues because God has not yet destroyed the wicked and brought about the foretold restoration of mankind . Should this embitter us ? Or can we see such situations as opportunities to have a share in proving the Devil a liar ? We can be strengthened to do so if we keep in mind the appeal : “ Be wise , my son , and make my heart rejoice , that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me . ” ( Proverbs 27 :11 ) Satan , the one who taunts Jehovah , charged that if people suffer material loss or physical affliction , they will blame God , even curse him . ( Job 1 :9-11 ; 2 :4 , 5 ) We bring joy to Jehovah ’ s heart when , by our loyalty to him in the face of hardships , we show that such is not true in our case .

How seriously does Jehovah take our obedience ? —1 Samuel 15 :22 , 23 .
“ We have heard a report from Jehovah ,
15 We have neither seen God nor heard his voice . ( John 1 :18 ) Yet , he invites us to enter into a loving relationship with him . ( James 4 :8 ) How can we do that ? The first step toward loving anyone is to take in knowledge of that one ; it is hard to feel deep affection for someone we do not know . Jehovah has provided his Word , the Bible , so that we can learn about him . That is why Jehovah , through his organization , encourages us to read the Bible regularly . It is the Bible that teaches us about God , his qualities , his personality , as well as his dealings with people over thousands of years . As we meditate on such accounts , our appreciation and love for him will grow .—Romans 15 :4 .
If you are going to use the information in a talk , ask yourself : ‘ Does the point I plan to use really contribute something worthwhile to my presentation of the subject ? Or , even though it is interesting material , does it tend to divert attention from the subject that I ought to be talking about ? ’ If you are considering using current events or material from the ever-changing fields of science or medicine , make sure that the information is up-to-date . Realize , too , that some points in older publications of ours may have been updated , so consider what has most recently been published on the topic .

19 As this system of things goes “ from bad to worse , ” we can expect to face increasingly greater difficulties . ( 2 Tim . 3 :1 , 13 ) So it is more important than ever that we do not allow ourselves to be paralyzed by such challenges . Rather , we need to cultivate strong trust in Jehovah while taking whatever appropriate action we can . How fitting , then , is our yeartext for 2017 : “ Trust in Jehovah and do what is good ” ! —Ps . 37 :3 .

4 Jesus spoke to many who were desperately trying to do what was lawful but who were “ loaded down ” because the Jewish leaders made religion a burdensome thing . ( Matthew 23 :4 ) They focused on endless rules for virtually all aspects of life . Would you not find it stressful to keep hearing “ you must not ” do this or that ? In contrast , Jesus ’ invitation was to truth , to righteousness , to a better life by listening to him . Yes , the way to know the true God involved paying attention to Jesus Christ , for in him , humans could—and can—see what Jehovah is like . Jesus said : “ He that has seen me has seen the Father also . ” —John 14 :9 .

16 On the other hand , those with a more restrictive conscience should not be critical of others , insisting that all view matters of conscience just as they do . ( Read Romans 14 :10 . ) Really , the conscience is best used as an internal judge , not as a license to judge others . Remember Jesus ’ words : “ Stop judging that you may not be judged . ” ( Matthew 7 :1 ) All in the congregation want to avoid making an issue of personal matters of conscience . Instead , we seek ways to promote love and unity , building one another up , not tearing one another down .—Romans 14 :19 .
In a school or university , one or more teachers help students to learn .In many places around the world , all children have to go to school for a certain number of years .
Often , though , we can allay anxieties by addressing them in a practical way . For example , when the Bible writer Paul felt “ anxiety for all the congregations , ” he worked hard to comfort and encourage those for whom he was concerned . ( 2 Corinthians 11 :28 ) In that respect , his anxiety proved to be an asset , for it moved him to extend needed help . The same can be true of us . The opposite attitude—apathy or indifference—would indicate a lack of loving concern .—Proverbs 17 :17 .
7 Who is this coming up like the Nile River ,
28 Is it not thrilling to contemplate how Christ has continued to refine his followers , training them to respect , live by , and benefit from Jehovah ’ s lofty moral standards ? Think again about the temple that Ezekiel saw in vision . Remember the lofty entrances . True , that temple is , not a physical place , but a spiritual one . Nevertheless , do we see it as real ? We enter into it , not just by going to a Kingdom Hall or by opening a Bible or by ringing a doorbell in the ministry . Those are physical acts involving tangible things . A hypocrite could do those things without ever entering Jehovah ’ s temple . However , if we do such things while at the same time living by Jehovah ’ s exalted moral standards and taking part in pure worship with the right heart attitude , we have entered into and are serving in that most sacred of places—the arrangement for the pure worship of Jehovah God ! Let us always cherish that precious privilege . Let us also keep doing our utmost to reflect Jehovah ’ s holiness by upholding his righteous standards !
57 Now as they were going along the road , someone said to him : “ I will follow you wherever you go . ” 58 But Jesus said to him : “ Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests , but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head . ” 59 Then he said to another : “ Be my follower . ” The man said : “ Lord , permit me first to go and bury my father . ” 60 But he said to him : “ Let the dead bury their dead , but you go and declare abroad the Kingdom of God . ” 61 And still another said : “ I will follow you , Lord , but first permit me to say good-bye to those in my household . ” 62 Jesus said to him : “ No man who has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well-suited for the Kingdom of God . ”

As the early Christian congregation grew , a situation that apparently involved discrimination arose . Greek-speaking Jews complained that their widows were not being treated fairly . To settle this issue , the apostles appointed seven men to make sure that nobody was neglected . These men all had Greek names , which seems to indicate that the apostles wanted to ease any tensions over background that might have existed among the early Christians . ( Acts 6 :2-6 ) Whether we realize it or not , we are all deeply influenced by our culture . ( Rom . 12 :2 ) Moreover , we likely hear neighbors , fellow workers , or schoolmates make derogatory remarks about those of another background , tribe , or skin color . How deeply are we affected by such biased views ? And how do we react when someone makes fun of our nationality—maybe by exaggerating some feature of our culture ? w16 .10 1 :7 , 8

3 The Bible clearly teaches that if you want to serve Jehovah , you should get baptized . Jesus told his followers : “ Make disciples of people of all the nations , baptizing them . ” ( Matthew 28 :19 ) Jesus also set the example by getting baptized himself . He was completely immersed in water , not just sprinkled with water on his head . ( Matthew 3 :16 ) Today when a Christian is baptized , he must also be completely immersed , or dipped , in water .
6 When we read in a foreign tongue , our heart may not be as involved as it would be in our own language . Moreover , the inability to communicate well in another language can be mentally and spiritually draining .

6 Of course , as servants of God , you and your spouse already know that marriage is precious , even sacred . Jehovah himself instituted the marriage arrangement . ( Read Matthew 19 :4-6 . ) However , if you are currently experiencing marital problems , just knowing that marriage is honorable may not be enough to motivate you and your mate to treat each other with love and respect . What , then , will move you to do so ? Note carefully how Paul addressed the subject of showing honor . He did not say , “ marriage is honorable ” ; rather , he said , “ let marriage be honorable . ” Paul was not merely making an observation ; he was giving an exhortation . Keeping that distinction in mind may help you find added motivation for rekindling esteem for your spouse . Why is that the case ?

19 Consider how a congregation elder in Canada learned the value of throwing his anxiety on Jehovah . He has a high-stress job as a schoolteacher and counselor , and he also has had to deal with an anxiety disorder . How has this brother coped ? “ Above all , ” he explains , “ I find that working hard to fortify my relationship with Jehovah gives me the greatest strength to cope with emotional difficulties . The support of true friends and spiritual brothers is vital in times of distress . I am open and honest with my wife about my feelings . Fellow elders and our circuit overseer were invaluable in helping me put things into perspective . I also sought medical help , made changes in the way I managed my time , and set aside time to relax and exercise . Gradually , I began to feel more in control . When there are things that I can not control , I leave matters in Jehovah ’ s hands . ”

13 Then Moses and El·e·aʹzar the priest and all the chieftains of the assembly went out to meet them outside the camp . 14 But Moses grew indignant at the appointed men of the combat forces , the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds who were coming in from the military expedition . 15 Moses said to them : “ Have you preserved all the females alive ? 16 Look ! They are the ones who by Baʹlaam ’ s word induced the Israelites to commit unfaithfulness toward Jehovah over the affair of Peʹor , so that the scourge came upon the assembly of Jehovah . 17 Now you should kill every male among the children and kill every woman who has had sexual relations with a man . 18 But you may keep alive all the young girls who have not had sexual relations with a man . 19 And you should camp outside the camp seven days . Every one of you who has killed someone and every one of you who has touched someone slain should purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your captives . 20 And you should purify from sin every garment , every article of skin , everything made of goat hair , and every article of wood . ”
Regarding a person who looks to him for help , God has promised : “ I shall protect him because he has come to know my name . ” ( Psalm 91 :14 ) Modern-day servants of God have experienced the truthfulness of that promise . Henryk in Poland has served Jehovah faithfully for 70 years , despite adversity and persecution . When Henryk was only 16 years old , his father was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp . Henryk and his brother were placed in a Nazi correctional facility for youths . After that , he was moved from one concentration camp to another . Concerning the events of those days , Henryk recalls : “ In all my trying situations , Jehovah never left me . He always helped me to remain faithful , even though several times death was staring me in the face . ” Yes , Jehovah gives his servants the faith and strength to endure .

7 “ Remember—never forget—the way you provoked Jehovah your God in the wilderness . From the day that you left the land of Egypt until your coming to this place , you have rebelled against Jehovah . 8 Even in Hoʹreb you provoked Jehovah , and Jehovah was so angry with you that he was ready to annihilate you . 9 When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets , the tablets of the covenant that Jehovah made with you , I remained on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights , eating no food and drinking no water . 10 Then Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone written on with God ’ s finger , and on them were all the words that Jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire in the day of the assembly . 11 At the end of the 40 days and 40 nights , Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone , the tablets of the covenant , 12 and Jehovah told me , ‘ Get up , go down quickly from here , because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly . They have quickly turned aside from the path I commanded them to follow . They have made a metal image for themselves . ’ 13 Jehovah then said to me , ‘ I have seen this people , and look ! it is an obstinate people . 14 Let me be , and I will annihilate them and wipe out their name from under the heavens , and let me make you a nation mightier and more numerous than they are . ’

5 Jehovah continued speaking to Moses , saying : 6 “ Tell the Israelites , ‘ If a man or a woman commits any of the sins of mankind and acts unfaithfully toward Jehovah , that person has become guilty . 7 He must confess the sin that he has committed and return the full amount as compensation for his guilt and also add a fifth of its value ; he is to give it to the one he wronged . 8 But if the victim does not have a close relative to receive the compensation , it should be returned to Jehovah and will belong to the priest , apart from the ram of atonement with which he will make atonement for him .
7 There are tangible ways that we can show respect for our gatherings . One way is by being present for the singing of Kingdom songs . Many of these are worded as prayers and should therefore be sung reverentially . Quoting Psalm 22 , the apostle Paul wrote of Jesus : “ I will declare your name to my brothers ; in the middle of the congregation I will praise you with song . ” ( Hebrews 2 :12 ) Hence , we should make it a point to be in our seats before the chairman introduces the song and then to concentrate on the meaning of the words while singing . May our singing reflect the feelings of the psalmist who wrote : “ I shall laud Jehovah with all my heart in the intimate group of upright ones and the assembly . ” ( Psalm 111 :1 ) Yes , singing praises to Jehovah is one very good reason to arrive early at our meetings and to stay until the end .

There are numerous situations for which the Bible provides no specific command . For example , the Scriptures do not contain detailed rules regarding what kind of clothing is appropriate attire for Christians . How does this reflect Jehovah ’ s wisdom ? Styles and customs vary not only in different parts of the world but also from one decade to the next . If the Bible had provided a list of acceptable styles of dress and grooming , it would now be out-of-date in that regard . For similar reasons , God ’ s inspired Word does not provide a lot of rules designed to govern a Christian ’ s choice of employment , health care , and entertainment . What should we do in situations that do not involve a direct Bible command ? Under such circumstances , it is our personal responsibility to examine the details and make a choice that is guided , not by mere personal preference , but by what Jehovah will approve of and bless .—Ps . 37 :5 . w16 .05 3 :2 , 6

They continued in this sin , and the sacred pole continued to stand in Sa·marʹi·a . ) 7 Je·hoʹa·haz was left with an army of only 50 horsemen , 10 chariots , and 10 ,000 foot soldiers , because the king of Syria had destroyed them , trampling them like the dust at threshing time .

“ I have seen that your father ’ s attitude toward me has changed , but the God of my father has been with me . 6 You yourselves certainly know that I have served your father with all my power . 7 And your father has tried to cheat me and has changed my wages ten times ; but God has not allowed him to do me harm . 8 If on the one hand he would say , ‘ The speckled ones will be your wages , ’ then the whole flock produced speckled ones ; but if on the other hand he would say , ‘ The striped ones will be your wages , ’ then the whole flock produced striped ones . 9 So God kept taking your father ’ s livestock away from him and giving it to me . 10 Once when the flock got into heat , I raised my eyes and saw in a dream that the he-goats mating with the flock were striped , speckled , and spotty . 11 Then the angel of the true God said to me in the dream , ‘ Jacob ! ’ to which I said , ‘ Here I am . ’ 12 And he continued , ‘ Raise your eyes , please , and see that all the he-goats mating with the flock are striped , speckled , and spotty , for I have seen all that Laʹban is doing to you . 13 I am the true God of Bethʹel , where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me . Now get up , go out of this land , and return to the land of your birth . ’ ”

At that he said : “ I have a right to be angry , so angry that I want to die . ” 10 But Jehovah said : “ You felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant , which you did not work for , nor did you make it grow ; it grew in one night and perished in one night . 11 Should I not also feel sorry for Ninʹe·veh the great city , in which there are more than 120 ,000 men who do not even know right from wrong , as well as their many animals ? ”

Ewa , a regular pioneer in Poland , acknowledges : “ If I did not regularly study God ’ s Word , I would stop growing in the accurate knowledge of Jehovah . My Christian identity would quickly begin to deteriorate , and my faith in God would weaken—I would be heading for spiritual bankruptcy . ” May that never happen to us ! Consider the example of a man who increased in accurate knowledge of Jehovah and consequently enjoyed His approval .

17 If unity and cleanness are to be maintained in a congregation , the elders must care for judicial matters promptly and in a loving way . Paul knew that God ’ s love is not guided by mere sentiment , and He does not turn a blind eye to wrongdoing . ( Prov . 15 :3 ) So Paul did not hold back from writing First Corinthians , a strong yet loving letter . Second Corinthians , written some months later , shows that progress was made because the elders had applied the apostle ’ s direction . If a Christian takes a false step before he is aware of it , qualified men should try to readjust him in a spirit of mildness .—Gal . 6 :1 .

41 However , Eʹsau harbored animosity against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him , and Eʹsau kept saying in his heart : “ The days of mourning for my father are getting closer . After that I am going to kill Jacob my brother . ” 42 When the words of her older son Eʹsau were told to Re·bekʹah , she at once sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him : “ Look ! Your brother Eʹsau is planning to take revenge by killing you . 43 Now , my son , do as I say . Get up and run away to my brother Laʹban at Haʹran . 44 Dwell with him for a while until your brother ’ s rage calms down , 45 until your brother ’ s anger toward you subsides and he forgets what you have done to him . Then I will send for you from there . Why should I lose both of you in one day ? ”

16 Later , Jehovah transferred the life of his Son from heaven to Mary ’ s womb , so that he came to be out of a woman . Mary was an imperfect woman . Yet , Jesus did not inherit imperfection from her , for he was “ God ’ s Son . ” At the same time , Jesus ’ human parents , as descendants of David , provided Him with both the natural and the legal rights of an heir of David . ( Acts 13 :22 , 23 ) At Jesus ’ baptism in 29 C .E . , Jehovah anointed him with holy spirit and said : “ This is my Son , the beloved . ” ( Matthew 3 :16 , 17 ) At last , the Seed had arrived ! ( Galatians 3 :16 ) It was time to reveal more about the sacred secret .—2 Timothy 1 :10 .

ONE facet of the sign that Jesus gave regarding “ the conclusion of the system of things ” was that “ the love of the greater number [ would ] grow cold . ” ( Matt . 24 :3 , 12 ) In the first century , the Jews , who claimed to be God ’ s people , allowed their love for God to grow cold .
How to Practice Godly Fear
4 How do wicked people affect us now ? After foretelling that this present era would involve “ critical times hard to deal with , ” the apostle Paul was inspired to write : “ Wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse . ” ( 2 Tim . 3 :1-5 , 13 ) Have you seen those prophetic words come true ? Many of us have been victims of wicked people , such as violent bullies , hateful bigots , and vicious criminals . Some of those are openly wicked ; others are impostors , hiding what they do under an appearance of righteousness . Even if we ourselves have not been victims , such wicked people still affect us . We are sickened at heart when we learn of their horrible acts . The way the wicked brutalize children , the elderly , and other defenseless ones fills us with horror . Wicked people exhibit a spirit that seems subhuman , animalistic , even demonic . ( Jas . 3 :15 ) Happily , Jehovah ’ s Word counters such bad news with good news .
8 Then the A·malʹek·ites came and fought against Israel in Rephʹi·dim . 9 At this Moses said to Joshua : “ Choose men for us and go out to fight against the A·malʹek·ites . Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill , with the rod of the true God in my hand . ” 10 Then Joshua did just as Moses told him , and he fought against the A·malʹek·ites . And Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
The June 1 , 1973 , issue of The Watchtower asked the question : “ Do . . . persons who have not broken their addiction to tobacco qualify for baptism ? ” The answer was : “ The Scriptural evidence points to the conclusion that they do not . ” After citing several relevant scriptures , The Watchtower explained why an unrepentant smoker should be disfellowshipped . ( 1 Cor . 5 :7 ) It said : “ This represents no effort to act in an arbitrary , dictatorial manner . The strictness really proceeds from God , who expresses himself through his written Word . ” A recent book on religion in the United States notes : “ Christian leaders have regularly revised their teachings to match the beliefs and opinions gaining support among their members and in the larger society . ” Has any religion other than Jehovah ’ s Witnesses been willing to rely fully on God ’ s Word , even when doing so presents a real challenge to some of its members ? w17 .02 4 :15
2 After his baptism , did Kevin stop making changes in his life ? No , for he still had work to do in cultivating and refining his Christian qualities . ( Eph . 4 :31 , 32 ) For example , he found that controlling his quick temper was surprisingly difficult . Kevin admitted , “ Learning to control my temper was actually harder than quitting my old vices ! ” Kevin made needed changes through earnest prayer and intense Bible study .

We win people ’ s hearts , not by boasting or drawing undue attention to ourselves , but by displaying a “ quiet and mild spirit . ” ( 1 Pet . 3 :3 , 4 ; Jer . 9 :23 , 24 ) Vain sentiments in our hearts will eventually show up in our actions . We might drop hints , for example , implying that we enjoy special privileges , possess inside information , or have special relationships with responsible brothers . Or we might explain things in such a way that only we get the credit for ideas or accomplishments that others also contributed to . Jesus set a wonderful example . A good portion of what he said was either a quotation from or an allusion to the Hebrew Scriptures . He modestly spoke that way so that his hearers would know that what he said was coming from Jehovah and was not the product of his own intellect or wisdom . w17 .01 4 :12

25 But the men refused to listen to him , so the man grabbed hold of his concubine and brought her outside to them . They raped her and abused her all night long until the morning . Then they sent her away at the break of dawn . 26 Early in the morning , the woman came and fell down at the entrance of the man ’ s house where her master was and lay there until it was light . 27 When her master got up in the morning and opened the doors of the house to go out to resume his journey , he saw the woman , his concubine , lying at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold . 28 So he said to her : “ Get up ; let us go . ” But there was no answer . The man then put her on the donkey and set out for his home .
Maria relates what happened : “ The school where I work as a teacher scheduled a seminar on the treatment of substance abuse . About 50 people from the remotest regions of Tuva were to attend . The group included teachers , psychologists , child-welfare inspectors , and others . ” For Maria , this meeting was an opportunity and a challenge . She explains : “ By nature I am shy , and I find it hard to witness informally . However , I prayed to Jehovah for courage to overcome my fear and use this opportunity to give a witness . ” Did she succeed ?

15 Then Moses said to Jehovah : 16 “ Let Jehovah , the God of the spirit of all people , appoint over the assembly a man 17 who will go out and come in before them and who will lead them out and bring them in , so that Jehovah ’ s assembly may not become like sheep that have no shepherd . ” 18 So Jehovah said to Moses : “ Take Joshua the son of Nun , a man in whom there is spirit , and lay your hand on him . 19 Then stand him before El·e·aʹzar the priest and before all the assembly , and you must commission him before their eyes . 20 You are to confer some of your authority on him , so that all the assembly of the Israelites may listen to him . 21 He will stand before El·e·aʹzar the priest , who will inquire in his behalf by the judgment of the Uʹrim before Jehovah . At his order they will go out and at his order they will come in , he and all the Israelites with him and all the assembly . ”

22 Nevertheless , the magic-practicing priests of Egypt did the same thing with their secret arts , so that Pharʹaoh ’ s heart continued to be obstinate , and he did not listen to them , just as Jehovah had said . 23 Then Pharʹaoh returned to his house , and he did not take this to heart either . 24 So all the Egyptians were digging all around the Nile for water to drink , because they could not drink any water of the Nile . 25 And seven full days passed after Jehovah struck the Nile .
Paul ’ s opposers tried in various ways to turn the common people and the authorities against the apostle . ( Acts 13 :50 ; 14 :2 , 19 ; 18 :12 , 13 ) Consider one event . The Christian elders of the Jerusalem congregation heard a rumor being spread among the Jews that Paul was preaching “ an apostasy from Moses . ” Such stories could lead some newly converted Jewish Christians to think that Paul did not respect God ’ s arrangements . Also , the Sanhedrin could declare Christianity an apostasy from Judaism . If that happened , Jews who associated with Christians could be punished . They would be made social outcasts and barred from witnessing in the temple or in synagogues . Hence , the congregation elders advised Paul to prove these rumors wrong by his going to the temple and doing something that God did not require of him but that was not objectionable .—Acts 21 :18-27 .

That is why Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and made it sacred .

12 Would true Christians ever be free to worship God openly and acceptably ? Yes ! Glimmers of spiritual light began to penetrate the darkness , thanks to two important factors . The first was the invention in the mid-15th century of a printing press that used movable type . Before printing was brought to the Western world , the Bible was painstakingly copied by hand . Copies of the Bible were rare and expensive . It has been said that it would take ten months for a skilled copyist to produce just one handwritten copy of the Bible ! In addition , the materials on which the copyists wrote ( vellum or parchment ) were costly . In contrast , using a press and paper—a more practical alternative—a skilled printer could produce 1 ,300 pages per day !

24 King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar then became frightened and quickly rose up and said to his high officials : “ Did we not tie up three men and throw them into the fire ? ” They answered the king : “ Yes , O king . ” 25 He said : “ Look !

1 From dawn till dusk , the beauty of visible light brings praise to Jehovah God . Yet , it was another kind of light that Jesus invited his disciples to possess— “ the light of life . ” ( John 8 :12 ) Possessing this spiritual enlightenment is a special privilege that includes serious responsibilities . Jesus instructed : “ Let your light shine before men , ” thereby benefiting others . ( Matt . 5 :16 ) Amid today ’ s deep spiritual darkness , this light must be shared , and the need has never been greater ! How can we , like Christ , let our light shine ?
Jesus leads the Christian congregation by means of holy spirit . We need holy spirit to help us resist temptation , to embolden and equip us for the ministry , and to enable us to make sound decisions . Should we not take advantage of every provision—including congregation meetings—to receive that spirit ? At many of our meetings , we review the fulfillment of Bible prophecy . As a result , we reinforce our conviction that Jehovah ’ s promises for the future will likewise be fulfilled . Of course , it is not just those who speak from the platform who encourage us . Fellow Christians who offer comments and sing from the heart also build us up . ( 1 Cor . 14 :26 ) And when we converse with our brothers and sisters before and after the meetings , we feel a sense of belonging and enjoy true refreshment .—1 Cor . 16 :17 , 18 . w16 .04 3 :6 , 7

They kindled a fire and received all of us kindly because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold . 3 But when Paul collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand . 4 When the foreign-speaking people caught sight of the venomous creature hanging from his hand , they began saying to one another : “ Surely this man is a murderer , and although he made it to safety from the sea , Justice did not permit him to keep on living . ” 5 However , he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm . 6 But they were expecting him to swell up or suddenly to drop dead . After they waited for a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him , they changed their mind and began saying he was a god .

10 Another natural desire is for recreation . When wholesome , it can be physically , mentally , and emotionally refreshing . But how do we react when Satan cleverly uses occasions of relaxation to try to alienate our thinking from God ’ s ? We know , for example , that Jehovah hates sexual immorality and violence . When movies , television programs , or theater performances feature those things , do we passively sit and take it all in ? Keep in mind , too , that Satan will see to it that such things become more debased as the time for his destruction nears , since “ wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse , misleading and being misled . ” ( 2 Timothy 3 :13 ) So we constantly need to be on guard against Satan ’ s designs .—Genesis 6 :13 ; Psalm 11 :5 ; Romans 1 :24-32 .

16 Every human life is important to Jehovah . Even an unborn baby is precious to him . Under the Law of Moses , if a person accidentally hurt a pregnant woman and either she or her baby died , Jehovah held that person guilty of manslaughter . This meant that even though it was an accident , someone had been killed and the life had to be compensated for . ( Read Exodus 21 :22 , 23 . ) To God , an unborn baby is a living person . Knowing that , how do you think he feels about abortion ? How do you think he feels when he sees millions of unborn babies killed every year ?

13 :1—Does this not contradict what is stated at Joshua 11 :23 ? No , for the conquest of the Promised Land consisted of two aspects : the national warfare that defeated 31 kings of the land of Canaan , which broke the power of the Canaanites , and the taking of full possession of the land by tribal and individual actions . ( Joshua 17 :14-18 ; 18 :3 ) Though the sons of Israel failed to drive the Canaanites away from among them completely , the survivors were no real threat to Israel ’ s security . ( Joshua 16 :10 ; 17 :12 ) Joshua 21 :44 states : “ Jehovah gave them rest all around . ”

16 Because Satan is the ruler of this world , we are not surprised to find that dishonesty is all around us . Daily we may face temptations to be dishonest . When people write up a résumé to apply for work , it is a common practice to lie and exaggerate , inventing credentials and falsifying experience . When people fill out forms for immigration , taxation , insurance , and the like , they commonly give false answers in order to get what they want . Many students cheat on tests , or when they write papers and reports for school , they may go to the Internet and plagiarize what they find there , falsely presenting someone else ’ s work as their own . And when people deal with corrupt officials , they often offer bribes to get what they want . We expect as much in a world where so many are “ lovers of themselves , lovers of money , . . . without love of goodness . ” —2 Timothy 3 :1-5 .

4 Jehovah , the Originator of love , well knows that love has immense power to bring out the best in others . So despite the persistent rebelliousness of unfaithful mankind , he has remained confident that some humans would respond to his love . And , indeed , millions have . Sadly , though , the religions of this corrupt world have left people confused about what it means to love God . Countless people say that they love God , but they seem to think that such love is merely a feeling to be expressed in words . Love for God may begin that way , just as a baby ’ s love for his parents may first show itself in a smile . In mature people , however , love involves more .

16 We can have a good conscience . If our conscience tells us that we have done something wrong , we feel guilty , maybe even hopeless and worthless . But there is no need to give up . If we beg Jehovah for forgiveness , we can be sure that he will listen to us and forgive us . ( Hebrews 9 :13 , 14 ) Jehovah wants us to talk to him about any of our problems and weaknesses . ( Hebrews 4 :14-16 ) As a result , we can be at peace with God .

14 After this he built an outer wall for the City of David west of Giʹhon in the valley and as far as the Fish Gate , and he continued it around to Oʹphel , and he made it very high . Further , he appointed army chiefs in all the fortified cities in Judah . 15 He then removed the foreign gods and the idol image from the house of Jehovah and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem , and he had them thrown outside the city . 16 He also prepared the altar of Jehovah and began to offer up communion sacrifices and thanksgiving sacrifices on it , and he told Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel . 17 Nevertheless , the people were still sacrificing on the high places , although only to Jehovah their God .

10 In Hebrews chapter 11 , the apostle Paul describes the trials that many unnamed servants of God endured . For example , the apostle mentions women of faith who lost their sons in death but later received them back by resurrection . Then he mentions others who “ would not accept release by some ransom , in order that they might attain a better resurrection . ” ( Heb . 11 :35 ) Though we can not be sure whom Paul had in mind , some , like Naboth and Zechariah , were stoned to death for obeying God and doing his will . ( 1 Ki . 21 :3 , 15 ; 2 Chron . 24 :20 , 21 ) Daniel and his companions clearly had the opportunity to “ accept release ” by compromising their integrity . Instead , their faith in God ’ s power enabled them , so to speak , to ‘ stop the mouths of lions ’ and ‘ quench the force of fire . ’ —Heb . 11 :33 , 34 ; Dan . 3 :16-18 , 20 , 28 ; 6 :13 , 16 , 21-23 .

The Gospels , as well as the rest of the Christian Greek Scriptures , were not written immediately following the death of Jesus . Matthew apparently wrote his Gospel about 7 or 8 years later , and John wrote his about 65 years later . How were they able to record the words and deeds of Jesus with unerring accuracy ? Clearly , God ’ s holy spirit played an active role in guiding them . ( John 14 :16 , 26 ) How , though , were the teachings of Jesus passed on accurately , eventually becoming a part of the Sacred Scriptures ?

59 Now the chief priests and the entire Sanʹhe·drin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death . 60 But they found none , although many false witnesses came forward . Later two came forward 61 and said : “ This man said , ‘ I am able to throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days . ’ ” 62 With that the high priest stood up and said to him : “ Do you say nothing in reply ? What is it these men are testifying against you ? ” 63 But Jesus kept silent . So the high priest said to him : “ I put you under oath by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ , the Son of God ! ” 64 Jesus said to him : “ You yourself said it . But I say to you : From now on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven . ” 65 Then the high priest ripped his outer garments , saying : “ He has blasphemed ! What further need do we have of witnesses ? See ! Now you have heard the blasphemy . 66 What is your opinion ? ” They answered : “ He deserves to die . ” 67 Then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists . Others slapped him on the face , 68 saying : “ Prophesy to us , you Christ . Who struck you ? ”

To keep me from becoming overly exalted , I was given a thorn in the flesh , an angel of Satan , to keep slapping me , so that I might not be overly exalted . 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this , that it would depart from me . 9 But he said to me : “ My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you , for my power is being made perfect in weakness . ” Most gladly , then , I will boast about my weaknesses , in order that the power of the Christ may remain over me like a tent . 10 So I take pleasure in weaknesses , in insults , in times of need , in persecutions and difficulties , for Christ . For when I am weak , then I am powerful .

31 Then in the 37th year of the exile of King Je·hoiʹa·chin of Judah , in the 12th month , on the 25th day of the month , King Eʹvil-merʹo·dach of Babylon , in the year he became king , released King Je·hoiʹa·chin of Judah and brought him out of prison . 32 He spoke kindly with him and put his throne higher than the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon . 33 So Je·hoiʹa·chin took off his prison garments , and he regularly ate before him all the days of his life . 34 A regular allowance of food was given him from the king of Babylon , day after day , until the day of his death , all the days of his life .

2 However , is there any difference between being baptized with holy spirit and being baptized in the name of the holy spirit ? Yes . Those who are baptized with holy spirit are born again as spirit-begotten sons of God . ( John 3 :3 ) They are anointed to be future associate kings and underpriests in God ’ s heavenly Kingdom , and they are part of the spiritual body of Christ . ( 1 Cor . 12 :13 ; Gal . 3 :27 ; Rev . 20 :6 ) So this baptism—being baptized with holy spirit—was what Jehovah performed when , on the day of Pentecost and thereafter , he chose individuals to become joint heirs with Christ . ( Rom . 8 :15-17 ) But what of water baptism in the name of the holy spirit , something that regularly occurs at assemblies and conventions of Jehovah ’ s people in our day ?

11 In a moving song of gratitude that Hezekiah composed after he was spared from a deadly sickness , he said to Jehovah : “ You have thrown behind your back all my sins . ” ( Isaiah 38 :17 ) Jehovah is here portrayed as taking the sins of a repentant wrongdoer and throwing them behind Him where He neither sees them nor takes notice of them anymore . According to one source , the idea conveyed may be expressed : “ You have made [ my sins ] as if they had not happened . ” Is that not reassuring ?

3 “ Then we turned and went up by way of Baʹshan . And Og , the king of Baʹshan , came out with all his people to meet us in battle at Edʹre·i . 2 So Jehovah said to me , ‘ Do not be afraid of him , for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand , and you will do to him just as you did to Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites , who lived in Heshʹbon . ’ 3 So Jehovah our God also gave King Og of Baʹshan and all his people into our hand , and we kept striking him down until none of his people survived . 4 We then captured all his cities . There was no town that we did not take from them—60 cities , all the region of Arʹgob , the kingdom of Og in Baʹshan . 5 All these cities were fortified with high walls , gates , and bars , along with a great number of rural towns . 6 However , we devoted them to destruction , just as we had done to King Siʹhon of Heshʹbon , in devoting every city to destruction , including men , women , and children . 7 And we took all the livestock and the spoil of the cities for ourselves .
Holy spirit is able to mold us in a number of ways . For instance , it can help us to develop a Christlike personality , which is characterized by the fruitage of God ’ s spirit . An aspect of that fruitage is love . We love God and want to obey him and be molded by him , recognizing that his commandments are not burdensome . Holy spirit can also give us the strength to resist the molding influence of the world and its bad spirit . ( Eph . 2 :2 ) The apostle Paul , who as a young man was deeply influenced by the proud spirit of Jewish religious leaders , could later write : “ For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power . ” ( Phil . 4 :13 ) So let us , like Paul , keep on asking for holy spirit . Jehovah will not ignore the sincere petitions of the meek .—Ps . 10 :17 . w16 .06 1 :12

15 In his consideration of the ministry of relief , Paul also explained to the Corinthians the benefits that they and other Christians would receive from sharing in this work . He stated : “ With supplication for you , they [ the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who received the assistance ] express affection for you because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of God upon you . ” ( 2 Cor . 9 :14 ) Yes , the generosity of the Corinthians would move the Jewish Christians to pray in behalf of their brothers in Corinth , including Gentiles , and would deepen their affection for them .

Understanding these valuable lessons strengthens our confidence that Jehovah does not destroy the righteous along with the wicked .

14 Outstandingly , Jesus had the power to undo death . On three recorded occasions , he raised the dead , giving a 12-year-old daughter back to her parents , an only child to his widowed mother , and a beloved brother to his sisters . ( Luke 7 :11-15 ; 8 :49-56 ; John 11 :38-44 ) No circumstance proved too formidable . He raised the 12-year-old girl from her deathbed shortly after she died . He resurrected the widow ’ s son from the funeral bier , no doubt on the day of his death . And he raised Lazarus from the burial tomb after he had been dead for four days .
Here is my passport .
10 The apostle Paul wrote : “ Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin , and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ” ( Rom . 5 :12 ) As descendants of Adam , all of us are subject to the law of sin and of death . Our sinful flesh constantly urges us to do things that are displeasing to God , with only death in view . In his letter to the Galatians , Paul called such acts and traits “ the works of the flesh . ” Then he added : “ Those who practice such things will not inherit God ’ s kingdom . ” ( Gal . 5 :19-21 ) People of this kind are the same as those who walk in accord with the flesh . ( Rom . 8 :4 ) Their “ inward principle of action ” and their ‘ standard for life ’ are totally fleshly . But are those who commit fornication , engage in idolatry , practice spiritism , or get involved in other gross sins the only ones who walk in accord with the flesh ? No , for the works of the flesh also include what some might consider mere personality flaws , such as jealousy , fits of anger , contentions , and envies . Who can say that he has totally freed himself from walking in accord with the flesh ?

And it seems that the scribe is too proud to accept this mode of life . Each of us , thus , can ask , ‘ How willing am I to follow Jesus ? ’

27 The casting of the socket pedestals of the holy place and the socket pedestals of the curtain amounted to 100 talents ; 100 socket pedestals equaled 100 talents , one talent for each socket pedestal . 28 From the 1 ,775 shekels , he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and joined them together .

30 The next day the national radio announced : “ We shall never again hear of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses in [ Zaire ] . ” Instant persecution followed . Kingdom Halls were destroyed , and our brothers were robbed , arrested , imprisoned , and beaten . Even Witness children were put in prison . On October 12 , 1988 , the government seized our organization ’ s belongings , and the Civil Guard , an army unit , occupied the branch property . The responsible brothers filed an appeal with President Mobutu , but they did not receive a reply . At that point , the Branch Committee had to make a weighty decision , “ Shall we appeal to the Supreme Court , or shall we wait ? ” Timothy Holmes , who was a missionary and the country ’ s Branch Committee coordinator at the time , recalls , “ We looked to Jehovah for wisdom and direction . ” After prayerful deliberation , the committee felt that the time for legal action was not right . Instead , they focused on caring for the brotherhood and on finding ways to continue the preaching work .

8 At that Hez·e·kiʹah said to Isaiah : “ The word of Jehovah that you have spoken is good . ” Then he added : “ Because there will be peace and stability during my lifetime . ”
9 Jehovah then said to Moses : “ Pharʹaoh will not listen to you , in order for my miracles to be multiplied in the land of Egypt . ” 10 Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Pharʹaoh , but Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh ’ s heart to become obstinate , so that he did not send the Israelites away from his land .

29 When he reached his house , he took the slaughtering knife and took hold of his concubine and cut her up limb by limb into 12 pieces and sent one piece into each territory of Israel . 30 All who saw it said : “ Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt down to this day .

Mike and Denise raised four children . How did their family benefit from working together ? Mike says : “ At times , even the best-laid plans did not work out , but we found that cooperation helped us to get to the meetings on time . ” Denise explains : “ When the children were growing up , each one had chores to do . Kim , our daughter , helped with cooking and setting the table . ” Their son Michael remembers : “ Tuesday night we had a congregation meeting in our home . So we cleaned up the room , vacuumed the floor , and put the chairs out . ” Matthew , another son , adds : “ Dad made sure that he was home from work early on meeting nights to take the lead in getting us ready for the meeting . ” What have been the results ?

4 Jehovah expects us to live by his standards of right and wrong . Since his standards are just and righteous , we are pursuing justice and righteousness when we conform to them . “ Learn to do good ; search for justice , ” says Isaiah 1 :17 . God ’ s Word exhorts us to “ seek righteousness . ” ( Zephaniah 2 :3 ) It also urges us to “ put on the new personality which was created according to God ’ s will in true righteousness . ” ( Ephesians 4 :24 ) True righteousness—true justice—shuns violence , uncleanness , and immorality , for these violate what is holy .—Psalm 11 :5 ; Ephesians 5 :3-5 .
8 Our awe can only increase when we contemplate the size of galaxies . The Milky Way galaxy has been estimated to measure some 100 ,000 light-years across . Picture a beam of light traveling at the tremendous speed of 186 ,000 miles each second ( 300 ,000 km/sec ) . It would take that beam 100 ,000 years to traverse our galaxy ! And some galaxies are many times the size of ours . The Bible says that Jehovah is “ stretching out ” these vast heavens as if they were mere fabric . ( Psalm 104 :2 ) He also orders the movements of these creations . From the smallest speck of interstellar dust to the mightiest galaxy , everything moves according to physical laws that God has formulated and put into effect . ( Job 38 :31-33 ) Thus , scientists have likened the precise movements of the celestial bodies to the choreography of an elaborate ballet ! Think , then , of the One who has created these things . Do you not stand in awe of the God having such immense creative power ?

16 Satan wants people to think that money and material things are what will make them happy , but Jehovah ’ s servants know that this is not true . We trust Jesus ’ words : “ Even when a person has an abundance , his life does not result from the things he possesses . ” ( Luke 12 :15 ) Money can not make us truly happy . It can not give us true friends , real peace of mind , or everlasting life . Of course , we need some material things , and we want to enjoy our life . But Jesus taught us that we will be happy if we have a good relationship with God and if our worship is the most important thing in our life . ( Matthew 5 :3 ; 6 :22 , footnote ) Ask yourself : ‘ Has the world ’ s view of money affected me ? Is money the main thing I think or talk about ? ’ —Luke 6 :45 ; 21 :34-36 ; 2 John 6 .

9 A second aspect of your building project is revealed in these inspired words : “ Let us press on to maturity . ” ( Hebrews 6 :1 ) Maturity is a wonderful goal for a Christian .

14 The apostle John made much the same point when he warned that if anyone loves the things in the world— “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one ’ s means of life ” —then “ the love of the Father is not in him . ” ( 1 John 2 :15 , 16 ) This means that we need to examine our heart constantly to see if it is being enticed by worldly entertainment , associations , and styles of dress and grooming . Or the love of the world might involve efforts to attain “ great things , ” such as through the pursuit of higher education . ( Jer . 45 :4 , 5 ) We stand at the threshold of the promised new world . Thus , how important it is that we keep well in mind Moses ’ powerful words ! If we clearly understand and firmly believe that “ Jehovah our God is one Jehovah , ” we will do all we can to give him exclusive devotion , serving him as he approves .—Heb . 12 :28 , 29 .

6 When it comes to freedom , a key point for us to bear in mind is that Jehovah God alone has what can be called absolute and unlimited freedom . Why ? Because he is the Creator of all things and the almighty Sovereign of the universe . ( 1 Tim . 1 :17 ; Rev . 4 :11 ) Recall the beautiful words of King David in describing the unique and lofty position that Jehovah alone occupies . ( Read 1 Chronicles 29 :11 , 12 . ) Accordingly , all creatures in heaven and on earth have freedom in only a relative sense . They must recognize that Jehovah God has the ultimate authority to impose what he determines to be just , necessary , and reasonable limits . That , in fact , was what Jehovah God did with his human creation right from the beginning .

38 Saul now clothed David with his garments . He put a copper helmet on his head , after which he clothed him with a coat of mail . 39 Then David strapped on his sword over his garments and tried to go but could not , for he was not used to them . David said to Saul : “ I am unable to go in these things , for I am not used to them . ” So David took them off . 40 He then took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the streambed and placed them in the pouch of his shepherd ’ s bag , and his sling was in his hand .

12 The authorities made good on that threat . As representatives of the Watch Tower Society , Brothers Rutherford , Van Amburgh , and six others were arrested .

Some years ago , Stephanie , now in her late 20 ’ s and also from the United States , took a close look at her circumstances and thought : ‘ I ’ m in good health and have no family obligations . Really , I could be doing much more for Jehovah than I ’ m doing right now . ’ That honest self-evaluation motivated her to move to Ghana to expand her ministry . Filip and Ida , a middle-aged pioneer couple from Denmark , always dreamed of moving to a territory where the need is greater . They searched for ways to make their dream come true . “ When the opportunity presented itself , ” says Filip , “ it was as if Jehovah told us : ‘ Go ahead ! ’ ” In 2008 they moved to Ghana and served there for more than three years .

Jesus said those words while he was on earth . But Christ has been empowered in heaven to wage war against Satan ’ s world . ( Rev . 19 :11-16 ) Thus , it is reasonable to conclude that Jesus now knows when Armageddon will occur . We , however , do not know . It is imperative that we stay watchful until the tribulation occurs . Yet , the timing of that event has never been uncertain to Jehovah . He has determined exactly when the end will come . He is counting down the time to the start of the great tribulation , and its start “ will not be late ! ” ( Hab . 2 :1-3 ) How can we be sure of this ? Jehovah ’ s prophecies have always been fulfilled right on time ! We can be certain that Jehovah ’ s promise of deliverance through the great tribulation will not fail us either . However , if we want to survive the destruction of this system , we must keep on the watch . w16 .07 2 :4-6

15 At that the angel of Jehovah told E·liʹjah : “ Go down with him . Do not be afraid of him . ” So he rose and went down with him to the king . 16 E·liʹjah then said to the king , “ This is what Jehovah says : ‘ You sent messengers to inquire of Baʹal-zeʹbub the god of Ekʹron . Is it because there is no God in Israel ? Why did you not inquire of his word ? Therefore , you will not leave the bed on which you are lying , for you will certainly die . ’ ” 17 So he died , according to the word of Jehovah that E·liʹjah had spoken ; and because he did not have a son , Je·hoʹram became king in his place , in the second year of Je·hoʹram the son of Je·hoshʹa·phat the king of Judah .

5 King David sang to Jehovah : “ You will give me your shield of salvation , and your own right hand will sustain me , and your own humility will make me great . ” ( Psalm 18 :35 ) In effect , Jehovah lowered himself in order to deal with this mere imperfect human , protecting and sustaining him day by day . David realized that if he was to find salvation—and even , eventually , achieve a measure of greatness as a king—it would be only because of Jehovah ’ s willingness to humble Himself in this way . Really , who of us would have any hope of salvation if Jehovah were not humble , willing to lower himself in order to deal with us as a mild and loving Father ?

18 Jehovah uses his holy spirit to answer our prayers . When we pray for help to cope with a problem , he may use his holy spirit to give us guidance and strength . ( 2 Corinthians 4 :7 ) Jehovah also uses the Bible to answer our prayers and to help us to make wise decisions . When we read the Bible , we may find scriptures that will help us . Jehovah can also motivate someone who comments at a meeting to say what we need to hear or an elder in the congregation to share a point from the Bible with us .—Galatians 6 :1 .

6 Having respect for life includes having the right view of fellow humans . The Bible says : “ Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him . ” ( 1 John 3 :15 ) If we want everlasting life , we need to root out of our heart any hatred for our fellow man , because hatred is the root cause of most violence . ( 1 John 3 :11 , 12 ) It is vital that we learn to love one another .
8 “ If a case arises in one of your cities that is too difficult for you to judge , whether it is a case involving bloodshed or a legal claim that has been raised or a violent deed that has been committed or other matters of dispute , you should rise up and go to the place that Jehovah your God chooses . 9 Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge serving in those days , and make your inquiry , and they will hand down the decision to you . 10 Then you must act according to the decision that they hand down to you from the place that Jehovah chooses . Be careful to do according to all that they instruct you . 11 You must act according to the law that they show you and according to the decision that they declare to you . Do not deviate from the decision that they will hand down to you , either to the right or to the left . 12 The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who is ministering to Jehovah your God or to the judge must die . You must remove what is bad from Israel . 13 All the people will then hear and become afraid , and they will not act presumptuously anymore .
10 After that the Israelites departed and camped in Oʹboth . 11 Then they departed from Oʹboth and camped in Iʹye-abʹa·rim , in the wilderness that faces Moʹab , toward the east . 12 From there they departed and camped by the Valley of Zeʹred . 13 From there they departed and camped in the region of the Arʹnon , which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amʹor·ites , for the Arʹnon is the boundary of Moʹab , between Moʹab and the Amʹor·ites . 14 That is why the book of the Wars of Jehovah speaks of “ Vaʹheb in Suʹphah and the valleys of Arʹnon , 15 and the descent of the valleys , which extends toward the settlement of Ar and adjoins the border of Moʹab . ”

28 When the news reached Joʹab—for Joʹab had supported Ad·o·niʹjah but he had not supported Abʹsa·lom—Joʹab fled to the tent of Jehovah and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar . 29 Then King Solʹo·mon was told : “ Joʹab has fled to the tent of Jehovah , and he is there beside the altar . ” So Solʹo·mon sent Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da , saying : “ Go , strike him down ! ” 30 So Be·naiʹah went to the tent of Jehovah and said to him : “ This is what the king says , ‘ Come out ! ’ ” But he said : “ No ! I will die here . ” Be·naiʹah brought word back to the king : “ This is what Joʹab said , and this is what he answered me . ” 31 Then the king said to him : “ Do just as he said ; strike him down and bury him and remove from me and from the house of my father the blood that Joʹab spilled without just cause . 32 Jehovah will bring his blood back on his own head , for without my father David ’ s knowledge , he struck down and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than he was : Abʹner the son of Ner , the chief of the army of Israel , and A·maʹsa the son of Jeʹther , the chief of the army of Judah . 33 Their blood will come back on the head of Joʹab and on the head of his offspring forever ; but for David , his offspring , his house , and his throne , may there be peace from Jehovah forever . ” 34 Then Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da went up and struck Joʹab down and put him to death , and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness . 35 Then the king appointed Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da over the army in his place , and the king appointed Zaʹdok the priest in place of A·biʹa·thar .

Gideon readily acknowledged his modest background and credentials . After he accepted Jehovah ’ s assignment , Gideon made sure that he thoroughly understood what was required , and he looked to Jehovah for guidance . ( Judg . 6 :36-40 ) Gideon was bold and courageous . Yet , he acted with caution and shrewdness . ( Judg . 6 :11 , 27 ) He did not seize upon his assignment to gain prominence . Rather , as soon as he could , he gladly returned to his former place . ( Judg . 8 :22 , 23 , 29 ) Being modest does not mean that we should never reach out for or accept additional privileges of service . The Scriptures encourage all of us to make advancement . ( 1 Tim . 4 :13-15 ) Does this always require a change of assignment though ? Not necessarily . With Jehovah ’ s blessing , we can make spiritual progress in whatever role we are currently serving . We can continue to cultivate our God-given abilities and expand in doing good works . w17 .01 3 :15 , 16

“ Men of Athens , I see that in all things you seem to be more given to the fear of the deities than others are . 23 For instance , while passing along and carefully observing your objects of veneration , I found even an altar on which had been inscribed ‘ To an Unknown God . ’ Therefore , what you are unknowingly worshipping , this I am declaring to you . 24 The God who made the world and all the things in it , being , as he is , Lord of heaven and earth , does not dwell in handmade temples ; 25 nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything , because he himself gives to all people life and breath and all things . 26 And he made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth , and he decreed the appointed times and the set limits of where men would dwell , 27 so that they would seek God , if they might grope for him and really find him , although , in fact , he is not far off from each one of us . 28 For by him we have life and move and exist , even as some of your own poets have said , ‘ For we are also his children . ’

Even to the half of my kingdom , it will be granted you ! ” 4 Esther replied : “ If it pleases the king , let the king along with Haʹman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him . ” 5 So the king said to his men : “ Tell Haʹman to come quickly , as Esther requests . ” So the king and Haʹman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
12 “ You will eat it as you would a round barley loaf ; you will bake it before their eyes , using dried human excrement as fuel . ” 13 Jehovah went on to say : “ This is how the Israelites will eat their bread—unclean—among the nations where I will disperse them . ”

7 Later Jehovah ’ s angel found her at a spring of waters in the wilderness , the spring on the way to Shur . 8 And he said : “ Haʹgar , servant of Sarʹai , where have you come from and where are you going ? ” To this she said : “ I am running away from my mistress Sarʹai . ” 9 Jehovah ’ s angel then said to her : “ Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand . ” 10 Then Jehovah ’ s angel said : “ I will greatly multiply your offspring , so that they will be too numerous to count . ” 11 Jehovah ’ s angel added : “ Here you are pregnant , and you will give birth to a son , and you must name him Ishʹma·el , for Jehovah has heard your affliction . 12 He will be a wild donkey of a man . His hand will be against everyone , and everyone ’ s hand will be against him , and he will dwell opposite all his brothers . ”

7 What has Jesus been doing in heaven since his return there ? He has tremendous authority . ( Matthew 28 :18 ) Indeed , Jehovah appointed him to rule over the Christian congregation , an assignment that he has carried out in a loving and just way . ( Colossians 1 :13 ) As foretold , Jesus has provided responsible men to care for the needs of his flock . ( Ephesians 4 :8 ) For example , he chose Paul to be “ an apostle to the nations , ” sending him to spread the good news far and wide . ( Romans 11 :13 ; 1 Timothy 2 :7 ) Near the end of the first century , Jesus directed messages of commendation , counsel , and correction to seven congregations in the Roman province of Asia . ( Revelation , chapters 2-3 ) Do you recognize Jesus as Head of the Christian congregation ? ( Ephesians 5 :23 ) In order to continue following him , you will want to promote an obedient , cooperative spirit in your local congregation .
Consider first the setting of Jesus ’ words . He was teaching in the temple on Nisan 11 , a few days before his death . His enemies tried to trip him up by asking him some controversial questions . Each time , he silenced them with his answers . Then , Jesus was asked this question : “ Which commandment is first of all ? ” —Verse 28 .
“ Later that day , two of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses knocked on Pat ’ s door and showed him some of the Bible ’ s practical advice .

It seemed a tall order in view of our precarious relationship .

8 Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory . 9 And he said to him : “ All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me . ” 10 Then Jesus said to him : “ Go away , Satan ! For it is written : ‘ It is Jehovah your God you must worship , and it is to him alone you must render sacred service . ’ ” 11 Then the Devil left him , and look ! angels came and began to minister to him .

9 So the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph , saying to him : “ In my dream , there was a vine before me . 10 And on the vine , there were three twigs , and as it was sprouting shoots , it blossomed , and its clusters ripened into grapes . 11 And Pharʹaoh ’ s cup was in my hand , and I took the grapes and squeezed them out into Pharʹaoh ’ s cup . After that I put the cup in Pharʹaoh ’ s hand . ” 12 Then Joseph said to him : “ This is its interpretation : The three twigs are three days . 13 Three days from now , Pharʹaoh will bring you out , restoring you to your office , and you will put Pharʹaoh ’ s cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cupbearer . 14 Nevertheless , you must remember me when things go well with you . Please show me loyal love and mention me to Pharʹaoh , in order to get me out of this place . 15 I was , in fact , kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews , and I have not done anything here for which they should put me in prison . ”
13 When Ath·a·liʹah heard the sound of the people running , she immediately came to the people at the house of Jehovah . 14 Then she saw the king standing there by the pillar according to the custom . The chiefs and the trumpeters were with the king , and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets . At this Ath·a·liʹah ripped her garments apart and cried out : “ Conspiracy ! Conspiracy ! ” 15 But Je·hoiʹa·da the priest commanded the chiefs of hundreds , those appointed over the army , and said to them : “ Take her out from among the ranks , and if anyone follows her , put him to death with the sword ! ” For the priest had said : “ Do not put her to death in the house of Jehovah . ” 16 So they seized her , and when she reached the place where the horses enter the king ’ s house , she was put to death there .
For they have not searched for your regulations .
9 So Jehovah said to Moses : “ Go in to Pharʹaoh and say to him , ‘ This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said : “ Send my people away so that they may serve me . 2 But if you refuse to send them away and you keep holding them , 3 look ! Jehovah ’ s hand will come against your livestock in the field . On the horses , the donkeys , the camels , the herd , and the flock , there will be a devastating plague . 4 And Jehovah will certainly make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt , and nothing that belongs to the Israelites will die . ” ’ ” 5 Moreover , Jehovah set an appointed time , saying : “ Tomorrow Jehovah will do this in the land . ”

Grazing nearby is a herd of about 2 ,000 swine , animals that are unclean according to the Law and that Jews should not even own . The demons say : “ Send us into the swine , so that we may enter into them . ” ( Mark 5 :12 ) Jesus tells them to go , and they enter the swine . At that , all 2 ,000 of them stampede over the cliff and drown in the sea below .

Furthermore , Noah had deep religious beliefs , and he did not keep them to himself . The Bible says that he was “ a preacher of righteousness . ” ( 2 Peter 2 :5 ) Undoubtedly , Noah expected opposition . His great-grandfather Enoch was a righteous man who foretold that God would execute judgment against the wicked . Evidently , this brought persecution against Enoch , though God did not permit his opposers to kill him . ( Genesis 5 :18 , 21-24 ; Hebrews 11 :5 ; 12 :1 ; Jude 14 , 15 ) With Satan , the demons , the Nephilim , and most of the people either indifferent or opposed to him , Noah needed courage as well as faith in Jehovah ’ s ability to safeguard him .

WHAT a wonderful hope true Christians share ! All of us , whether of the anointed or of the “ other sheep , ” hope to see the fulfillment of God ’ s original purpose and the sanctification of Jehovah ’ s name . ( John 10 :16 ; Matt . 6 :9 , 10 ) Such expectations are the most noble any human can cherish . We also long for the promised reward of everlasting life , either as part of God ’ s “ new heavens ” or as part of his “ new earth . ” ( 2 Pet . 3 :13 ) In the meantime , we hope for the continued increase of the spiritual prosperity of God ’ s people .

18 Christian elders have been put in place by Jehovah through our King , Jesus , to carry out a weighty task . What is it ? To lead God ’ s sheep through the most critical time in human history . ( Eph . 4 :11 , 12 ; 2 Tim . 3 :1 ) Jehovah and Jesus have deep affection for hardworking elders because these brothers obey the Scriptural admonition : “ Shepherd the flock of God under your care . . . willingly . . . , eagerly . . . , becoming examples to the flock . ” ( 1 Pet . 5 :2 , 3 ) Let us consider two of the many ways in which Christian shepherds are examples to the flock and greatly contribute to peace and joy in the congregation .

5 In due time , Jehovah taught his Son about the ministry that he would carry out on earth . Consider a prophecy that describes the relationship between the Grand Instructor and his firstborn Son . ( Read Isaiah 50 :4 , 5 . ) Jehovah awakened his Son “ morning by morning , ” says the prophecy . That word picture conveys the idea of a teacher who wakes his pupil up early in the morning in order to teach him . One Bible reference work states : “ Jehovah . . . takes him as it were into the school after the manner of a pupil , and teaches him what and how he is to preach . ” In that heavenly “ school , ” Jehovah taught his Son “ what to say and what to speak . ” ( John 12 :49 ) The Father also gave his Son instruction on how to teach . While on earth , Jesus put his training to good use not only by carrying out his ministry but also by training his followers to fulfill their ministry .

12 Consider a recent decision made by the Governing Body . “ Questions From Readers ” in The Watchtower of November 15 , 2014 , outlined an adjustment in how elders and ministerial servants are appointed . The article noted that the first-century governing body authorized traveling overseers to make such appointments . In line with that pattern , since September 1 , 2014 , circuit overseers have been appointing elders and ministerial servants . The circuit overseer tries to get to know the men who are recommended and to work with them in the field service if possible . He also observes the family of the brother under consideration . ( 1 Tim . 3 :4 , 5 ) The body of elders and the circuit overseer carefully consider the Scriptural qualifications for ministerial servants and elders .—1 Tim . 3 :1-10 , 12 , 13 ; 1 Pet . 5 :1-3 .

14 What if we go into business with a brother or a sister ? This might involve an investment or a loan . In situations such as these , there is a very useful Bible principle : Put everything in writing ! When the prophet Jeremiah bought some land , he wrote two copies of the agreement , had one copy signed by witnesses , and stored both documents for future reference . ( Jeremiah 32 :9-12 ; see also Genesis 23 :16-20 . ) Some feel that writing an agreement down could make it seem as if they do not trust their brother . But in reality , writing down the agreement can prevent many misunderstandings , disappointments , and disagreements . Even in business matters , remember that the peace of the congregation is more important than any business deal .—1 Corinthians 6 :1-8 ; see Endnote 30 .
“ Now , there was about this time Jesus , a wise man , if it be lawful to call him a man , for he was a doer of wonderful works—a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure . He drew over to him both many of the Jews , and many of the Gentiles . He was [ the ] Christ ; and when Pilate , at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us , had condemned him to the cross , those that loved him at the first did not forsake him , for he appeared to them alive again the third day , as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him ; and the tribe of Christians , so named from him , are not extinct at this day . ” —Josephus—The Complete Works , translated by William Whiston .
16 One woman who gave birth to a baby boy while living in a foreign country was going to send the child back to her homeland to be cared for by his grandparents . At the time of the birth , one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses began to study the Bible with the woman . She made good progress and learned that it was her God-given duty to raise her child to worship Jehovah . ( Ps . 127 :3 ; Prov . 22 :6 ) The young woman poured out her heart to Jehovah , as the Scriptures tell us to do . ( Ps . 62 :7 , 8 ) She also opened her heart to her Bible teacher and spoke to others in the congregation . Despite pressure from her relatives and friends to send her child to the grandparents , she concluded that it was not right to do so . Her husband was so impressed by the way the congregation proved to be a refuge for her and the baby that he accepted a Bible study and began to attend meetings with his wife and child . Do you think that this mother felt that Jehovah answered her heartfelt prayer ? Undoubtedly , she did feel that way .

16 The spirit of the world is deceptive and impels millions to look to money and material things for happiness . However , Jesus said : “ Even when a person has an abundance , his life does not result from the things he possesses . ” ( Luke 12 :15 ) While not endorsing asceticism , or extreme self-denial , Jesus taught that life and genuine happiness come to those who are “ conscious of their spiritual need ” and those who maintain a simple life , one that is focused on spiritual things . ( Matthew 5 :3 ; 6 :22 , footnote ) Ask yourself : ‘ Do I truly believe what Jesus taught , or am I being influenced by “ the father of the lie ” ? ( John 8 :44 ) What do my words , my goals , my priorities , and my way of life reveal ? ’ —Luke 6 :45 ; 21 :34-36 ; 2 John 6 .

A solid marriage is made up of two people who make allowances for each other ’ s imperfections . They ‘ continue putting up with each other and forgiving each other freely . ’ Yes , both mates will make mistakes . When that happens , however , there are opportunities to learn from these errors , to be forgiving , and to let love have full sway as “ a perfect bond of union . ” ( Col . 3 :14 ) Moreover , “ love is patient and kind . . . . It does not keep account of the injury . ” ( 1 Cor . 13 :4 , 5 ) Misunderstandings should be cleared away as soon as possible . A Christian couple , therefore , should try to settle any issue between them before the day ends .

7 “ And Jehovah will save the tents of Judah first , so that the beauty of the house of David and the beauty of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be too great over Judah . 8 In that day Jehovah will be a defense around the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; in that day the one who stumbles among them will be like David , and the house of David like God , like Jehovah ’ s angel who goes before them . 9 And in that day I will be certain to annihilate all the nations that come against Jerusalem .

5 However , what if people tell us that they do not believe the Bible ? Should that end the conversation ? Not if they are willing to reason . It may be that they view the Bible as Christendom ’ s book . Her record of hypocrisy and political meddling , as well as her constant solicitations for money , may account for their negative reaction to the Bible . Why not ask if that is so ? The Bible ’ s condemnation of Christendom ’ s worldly ways , along with points of contrast between Christendom and true Christianity , may arouse their interest .—Micah 3 :11 , 12 ; Matthew 15 :7-9 ; James 4 :4 .

8 Judah then urged Israel his father : “ Send the boy with me , and let us go on our way so that we may live and not die—we and you and our children . 9 I will be a guarantee for his safety . You may hold me responsible .

14 The Bible shows that husbands and wives have different roles in the family . So it makes sense that being ready for marriage will mean something different depending on whether you are male or female . If a man is thinking of getting married , he needs to ask himself if he is ready to be the head of a family . Jehovah expects a husband to look after his wife and children materially and emotionally . Most important , the husband needs to take the lead in his family ’ s worship of God . The Bible describes a man who does not take care of his family as “ worse than a person without faith . ” ( 1 Timothy 5 :8 ) So if you are a man who is thinking about getting married , think of how this Bible principle can apply : “ Prepare your outside work , and get everything ready in the field ; then build your house . ” In other words , before you get married , make sure that you can be the kind of husband Jehovah requires you to be .—Proverbs 24 :27 .

16 We must admit that it is not always easy to make a decision that shows good judgment , that is sensible , and that takes all factors into account . Many stores cater to popular fashions , so it may take more time and effort to find modest skirts , dresses , and blouses or suits and slacks that are not too tight . Yet , fellow believers will likely note and appreciate the results of our sincere efforts to find attractive and appropriate clothing . And the satisfaction we have of bringing glory to our loving heavenly Father more than makes up for any inconveniences that we may face to dress so as to glorify him .

EVER since humankind fell into sin and imperfection , Jehovah has proved that he is a God who gives encouragement . Immediately after the rebellion in Eden , he gave Adam ’ s future descendants reason to take courage . All was not lost for the human family . Once understood , the prophetic promise written at Genesis 3 :15 would give humankind hope that eventually “ the original serpent , ” Satan the Devil , and all his evil works would be destroyed .—Rev . 12 :9 ; 1 John 3 :8 .

However , as you continue to learn how Jehovah views matters , you may see the need to adjust your thinking about certain celebrations .

4 Christian parents cooperate with Jehovah when they set theocratic goals before their children . Many who have done so have later seen their sons and daughters take up full-time service assignments far from home . Some are missionaries ; others pioneer where the need for publishers is greater ; still others serve at Bethel . Distance might mean that families can not get together as often as they would like to . Nevertheless , the self-sacrificing parents encourage their children to persevere in their assignments . Why ? They find great joy and satisfaction in knowing that their children are putting Kingdom interests first . ( 3 John 4 ) Perhaps many of these parents feel like Hannah , who said that she “ lent ” her son Samuel to Jehovah . These parents rightly view such cooperation as a precious privilege . They would not want things any other way .—1 Sam . 1 :28 .
12 This was when they were few in number ,
8 Is it enough just to say that we love Jehovah ? No . If we love Jehovah with our whole heart , soul , and mind , we will show our love for him by our actions . ( Matthew 7 :16-20 ) The Bible clearly teaches that if we love God , we will obey his commandments . Is that difficult ? No , because Jehovah ’ s “ commandments are not burdensome . ” —Read 1 John 5 :3 .
In the Nicomachean Ethics , written in 350 BCE , Aristotle stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for its own sake , unlike riches , honour , health or friendship . He observed that men sought riches , or honour , or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy . Note that eudaimonia , the term we translate as "happiness" , is for Aristotle an activity rather than an emotion or a state .Thus understood , the happy life is the good life , that is , a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way . Specifically , Aristotle argues that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity . He arrives at this claim with the Function Argument . Basically , if it's right , every living thing has a function , that which it uniquely does . For humans , Aristotle contends , our function is to reason , since it is that alone that we uniquely do . And performing one's function well , or excellently , is good . Thus , according to Aristotle , the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life . Aristotle does not leave it at that , however . He argues that there is a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity . This second best life is the life of moral virtue .
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need .—Matt . 5 :3 .
15 As soon as Gidʹe·on heard him relate the dream and its interpretation , he bowed down to worship . After that he returned to the camp of Israel and said : “ Get up , for Jehovah has given the camp of Midʹi·an into your hand . ” 16 Then he divided the 300 men into three bands and gave all of them horns and large empty jars with torches inside the jars . 17 Then he said to them : “ Watch me and do exactly what I do . When I come to the edge of the camp , you should do just as I do . 18 When I blow the horn , I and all who are with me , you also must blow the horns all around the camp and shout , ‘ For Jehovah and for Gidʹe·on ! ’ ”
18 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses , saying : 2 “ Speak to the Israelites and say to them , ‘ I am Jehovah your God . 3 You must not behave as they do in the land of Egypt , where you were dwelling , and you must not do what they do in the land of Caʹnaan , where I am bringing you . And you must not walk in their statutes . 4 You should carry out my judicial decisions , and you should keep my statutes and walk in them . I am Jehovah your God . 5 You must keep my statutes and my judicial decisions ; anyone who does so will live by means of them . I am Jehovah .
THE disciples traveling with Jesus have a rare privilege . They are learning directly from the Great Teacher . They get to hear his voice as he opens up the meaning of God ’ s Word and teaches them thrilling truths . For now , they must carry his precious sayings in their minds and hearts ; it is not yet the time for his words to be preserved in writing . However , Jesus makes it easier for them to remember what he teaches . How ? By his way of teaching , especially his masterful use of illustrations .

The ability to read aloud from the Bible and from publications that explain the Bible is important for youths and older ones alike . As Witnesses of Jehovah , we have a responsibility to share with others a knowledge of Jehovah and his ways . That often involves reading to one person or to a small group . We also do such reading within the family circle . In the Theocratic Ministry School , there are appropriate opportunities for brothers and sisters , young and old , to receive counsel with a view to improving their oral reading .
16 Jehovah eventually said to Samuel : “ How long will you mourn for Saul now that I have rejected him from ruling as king over Israel ? Fill your horn with oil and go . I will send you to Jesʹse the Bethʹle·hem·ite , because I have selected from among his sons a king for myself . ” 2 But Samuel said : “ How can I go ? When Saul hears about it , he will kill me . ” Jehovah replied : “ Take a young cow with you and say , ‘ I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah . ’ 3 Invite Jesʹse to the sacrifice ; then I will make known to you what to do . You must anoint for me the one whom I designate to you . ”
14 How would mankind be freed from their struggle with inherited imperfection ? Jehovah provided for a Kingdom government made up of “ the last Adam ” and chosen associates from among mankind . ( Read Revelation 5 :9 , 10 . ) Those associated with Jesus in heaven will have experienced what it means to be imperfect . For a full thousand years , their joint rulership will provide assistance to those on earth , helping them to overcome the imperfection that they could not conquer on their own .—Rev . 20 :6 .

25 Then Jehovah said to Moses : 26 “ You should tell the Levites , ‘ You will receive from the Israelites the tenth part that I have given to you from them for your inheritance , and you should contribute from it a tenth part of the tenth part as a contribution to Jehovah . 27 And it will be considered your contribution , as though it were the grain of the threshing floor or the full production of the winepress or oil press . 28 In this way you will also give a contribution to Jehovah from all the tenth parts that you receive from the Israelites , and from them you are to give the contribution for Jehovah to Aaron the priest . 29 You will make every sort of contribution to Jehovah from the very best of all the gifts given to you as something holy . ’

16 The psalmist wrote : “ O you who love Jehovah , hate what is bad . ” ( Psalm 97 :10 ) The Bible teaches us how Jehovah thinks and feels . Ask yourself how what you learn can help you to view things as Jehovah does . For example , we learn that Jehovah hates “ a lying tongue , and hands that shed innocent blood , a heart plotting wicked schemes , and feet that run quickly to evil . ” ( Proverbs 6 :16-19 ) We learn that we must avoid “ sexual immorality , . . . idolatry , spiritism , . . . jealousy , fits of anger , . . . envy , drunkenness , wild parties , and things like these . ” ( Galatians 5 :19-21 ) Do you see how these Bible principles can help you to choose your entertainment ? We want to follow Jehovah ’ s standards in all areas of our life , both when we are with others and when we are by ourselves . ( 2 Corinthians 3 :18 ) In fact , the choices we make when we are alone often reveal the kind of person we really are .—Psalm 11 :4 ; 16 :8 .

2 In effect , Satan was saying that humans would be better off making their own decisions rather than obeying God ’ s laws . He thus challenged God ’ s way of ruling . This raised the all-important issue of God ’ s universal sovereignty , that is , his right to rule . The question was raised : Which is better for humans , Jehovah ’ s way of ruling or rulership independent of him ? Now , Jehovah could have immediately executed Adam and Eve , but that would hardly have settled the issue of sovereignty satisfactorily . By letting human society develop for a considerable time , God could demonstrate just what independence from him and his laws would produce .

13 Jesus also made clear what justice is in that a new law , “ the law of the Christ , ” came into being after he completed his earthly ministry . ( Galatians 6 :2 ) Unlike its predecessor , the Mosaic Law , this new law largely depended , not upon a series of written commands , but upon principle . It did include some direct commands , though . One of these Jesus called “ a new commandment . ” Jesus taught all his followers to love one another just as he had loved them . ( John 13 :34 , 35 ) Yes , self-sacrificing love was to be the hallmark of all those who live by “ the law of the Christ . ”

6 This fact has been acknowledged by some of the finest legal minds . For example , the noted 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone wrote that no human law should be allowed to contradict “ the law of revelation ” as found in the Bible . Thus , the Sanhedrin crossed the line when it ordered the apostles to stop preaching . The apostles simply could not comply with that order .
9 Surely you remember , brothers , our labor and toil . We were working night and day , so that we would not put an expensive burden on any one of you , when we preached the good news of God to you . 10 You are witnesses , God is also , of how loyal and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers . 11 You well know that we kept exhorting and consoling you and bearing witness to each one of you , just as a father does his children , 12 so that you would go on walking worthily of God , who is calling you to his Kingdom and glory .

16 Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens , his spirit within him became irritated on seeing that the city was full of idols . 17 So he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshipped God and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand . 18 But some of both the Ep·i·cu·reʹan and the Stoʹic philosophers began disputing with him , and some were saying : “ What is it this chatterer would like to tell ? ” Others : “ He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities . ” This was because he was declaring the good news of Jesus and the resurrection . 19 So they took hold of him and led him to the Ar·e·opʹa·gus , saying : “ Can we get to know what this new teaching is that you are speaking about ? 20 For you are introducing some things that are strange to our ears , and we want to know what these things mean . ” 21 In fact , all Athenians and the foreigners staying there would spend their leisure time doing nothing else but telling or listening to something new . 22 Paul now stood in the midst of the Ar·e·opʹa·gus and said :

2 As used in the Bible , a vow is a solemn promise that is made to God . A person promises to perform some act , to offer some gift , to enter some type of service , or to abstain from certain things . Vows are made voluntarily , of one ’ s own free will . Nevertheless , they are sacred and binding in God ’ s eyes because they carry the force of an oath—a sworn statement—that promises that a person will or will not do a certain thing . ( Gen . 14 :22 , 23 ; Heb . 6 :16 , 17 ) What do the Scriptures say about the seriousness of making vows to God ?

( John 18 :3-8 ) Later he was led before the Sanhedrin and questioned by the high priest . Even though he knew that the high priest was looking for a pretext to kill him , Jesus fearlessly affirmed that He was both Christ and the Son of God . He added that they would see him “ sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven . ” ( Mark 14 :53 , 57-65 ) Shortly thereafter , Jesus stood bound before Pilate , who could have freed him . But Jesus remained silent in response to the accusations against him . ( Mark 15 :1-5 ) All of this took much courage .

3 What the prophets had foretold came to pass . Through Jeremiah , Jehovah advised the future exiles to accept their new situation and make the most of it . He said : “ Build houses [ in Babylon ] and live in them . Plant gardens and eat their fruit . And seek the peace of the city to which I have exiled you , and pray in its behalf to Jehovah , for in its peace you will have peace . ” ( Jer . 29 :5 , 7 ) Those who submitted to the will of God lived a relatively normal life in Babylon . Their captors allowed them to administer their own affairs to some extent . The exiles even had freedom to move about the country . Babylon was a center of trade and commerce in the ancient world , and documents that have been unearthed indicate that many Jews learned the art of buying and selling there , while others became skilled craftsmen . Some Jews even became prosperous . Exile in Babylon was nothing like the slavery in Egypt that the Israelites had experienced centuries before .—Read Exodus 2 :23-25 .

Today , many people misuse their freedom to make choices in life even to the harm of others . Indeed , just as the Bible foretold , during “ the last days ” men would be “ unthankful . ” ( 2 Tim . 3 :1 , 2 ) May we never misuse this precious gift from Jehovah or take it for granted . How , though , can we avoid misusing our gift of free will ? All of us have freedom of choice regarding associations , styles of dress and grooming , and entertainment . However , our freedom could become “ a cover for doing wrong ” if we chose to become slaves of our own fleshly desires or if we adopted the disgraceful fads and trends of the world . ( 1 Pet . 2 :16 ) Instead of using our freedom “ as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires , ” we want to be determined to make choices that help us to heed the admonition : “ Do all things for God ’ s glory . ” —Gal . 5 :13 ; 1 Cor . 10 :31 . w17 .01 2 :12-14

Ac 8 :3 S . began to ravage the congregation
11 From 1964 to 1971 , the governing body supervised an extensive Bible study project that examined , among many other subjects , how the first-century Christian congregation functioned . As to organization structure , it was learned that the oversight of congregations in the first century was carried out by a body of elders instead of just by one elder , or overseer . ( Read Philippians 1 :1 ; 1 Timothy 4 :14 . ) When that point was better understood , the governing body realized that their King , Jesus , was guiding them in making improvements in the organizational structure of God ’ s people—and the brothers of the governing body were determined to yield to the King ’ s direction . They promptly made adjustments to bring the organization into fuller harmony with the elder arrangement set out in the Scriptures . What are some adjustments that were made in the early 1970 ’ s ?
13 Share in relief work . The sufferings of those struck by disasters move many to manifest compassion . Jehovah ’ s people are known for coming forward to help in such times of need . ( 1 Pet . 2 :17 ) One Japanese sister lived in an area that was seriously damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 . She says that she was “ very encouraged and comforted ” by the efforts of the many volunteers from elsewhere in Japan and from overseas to repair property damage . She writes : “ This experience helped me to realize that Jehovah cares . And fellow Witnesses care about one another . Many brothers and sisters all over the world are praying for us . ”

11 Why is it important that we obey the new commandment ? Recall that Jesus said : “ By this [ self-sacrificing love ] all will know that you are my disciples . ” Yes , self-sacrificing love identifies us as true Christians . We might compare this love to an identification badge . Delegates attending the annual conventions of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses wear badge cards . The card identifies the wearer , showing his name and congregation . Self-sacrificing love for one another is the “ badge ” that identifies genuine Christians . In other words , the love we show one another should be so noticeable that it would serve as a sign , or badge , telling observers that we are indeed true followers of Christ . Each of us does well to ask himself , ‘ Is the “ badge ” of self-sacrificing love evident in my life ? ’
In 2008 , mudslides and floods in the state of Santa Catarina forced some 80 ,000 people out of their homes . It was like a “ tsunami of clay , mud and trees , ” said a resident . Some brothers found shelter in an Assembly Hall . “ They escaped with only the clothes they were wearing , all soaked with mud , ” relates Márcio , the hall ’ s caretaker . Says one sister : “ Our house collapsed . It was painful to see it disappear in seconds , but I will never forget how our brothers and sisters comforted us . We received so many expressions of love ! The experience taught me how wise it is to treasure spiritual things . ”

We are all born imperfect . ( Rom . 5 :12 , 19 ) So at times some in the congregation may hurt us by what they say or do . This can test our love for Jehovah and for his people . What will we do on such occasions ? For example , High Priest Eli had two sons who did not uphold Jehovah ’ s laws . We read : “ The sons of Eli were wicked men ; they had no regard for Jehovah . ” ( 1 Sam . 2 :12 ) Though their father played a key role in promoting true worship , his two sons committed very serious sins . Eli knew about this and should have disciplined them , but he was lax in that regard . As a result , God adversely judged the household of Eli . ( 1 Sam . 3 :10-14 ) In time , his descendants would not be allowed to serve as high priests . Had you lived in Eli ’ s day , how would you have reacted to Eli ’ s toleration of the sins committed by his sons ? Would you have let it stumble you to the point that you would no longer serve God ? w16 .06 4 :5 , 6
2 Then Jehovah said to Satan : “ Where have you come from ? ” Satan answered Jehovah : “ From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it . ” 3 And Jehovah said to Satan : “ Have you taken note of my servant Job ? There is no one like him on the earth . He is an upright man of integrity , fearing God and shunning what is bad . He is still holding firmly to his integrity , even though you try to incite me against him to destroy him for no reason . ” 4 But Satan answered Jehovah : “ Skin for skin . A man will give everything that he has for his life . 5 But , for a change , stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh , and he will surely curse you to your very face . ”
29 “ ‘ This is the law about jealousy , when a woman may go astray and defile herself while under her husband ’ s authority , 30 or in the case of a man who becomes jealous and suspects his wife of unfaithfulness ; he should make his wife stand before Jehovah , and the priest must carry out toward her all this law . 31 The man will be free from guilt , but his wife will answer for her guilt . ’ ”

11 How can I use this information to help others ? We could use the list of qualifications for Christian overseers to help interested ones or Bible students to see ways that elders among Jehovah ’ s Witnesses differ from the clergy of Christendom . Also , when reading through the list , we might recall the effort that elders in our own congregation are putting forth in our behalf . Reflecting on how they expend themselves deepens our “ respect for those who are working hard ” among us . ( 1 Thess . 5 :12 ) And the more we show our sincere respect for these hardworking overseers , the more we add to their joy .—Heb . 13 :17 .

17 Then the lot fell for the tribe of Ma·nasʹseh , because he was Joseph ’ s firstborn . Since Maʹchir , the firstborn of Ma·nasʹseh and the father of Gilʹe·ad , was a man of war , he received Gilʹe·ad and Baʹshan . 2 And the lot fell for the rest of the descendants of Ma·nasʹseh according to their families , for the sons of Abi-eʹzer , the sons of Heʹlek , the sons of Asʹri·el , the sons of Sheʹchem , the sons of Heʹpher , and the sons of She·miʹda . These were the descendants of Ma·nasʹseh the son of Joseph , the males according to their families . 3 But Ze·loʹphe·had the son of Heʹpher , the son of Gilʹe·ad , the son of Maʹchir , the son of Ma·nasʹseh , did not have sons , only daughters , and these were the names of his daughters : Mahʹlah , Noah , Hogʹlah , Milʹcah , and Tirʹzah . 4 So they presented themselves before El·e·aʹzar the priest , Joshua the son of Nun , and the chieftains , saying : “ It was Jehovah who commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers . ” So at the order of Jehovah , he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father .

5 Jehovah spoke again to Moses , saying : 6 “ Take the Levites from among the Israelites , and cleanse them . 7 This is how you should cleanse them : Sprinkle sin-cleansing water on them , and they must shave their whole body with a razor , wash their garments , and cleanse themselves . 8 Then they will take a young bull and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil , and you will take another young bull for a sin offering . 9 And you are to present the Levites before the tent of meeting and gather all the assembly of the Israelites . 10 When you present the Levites before Jehovah , the Israelites are to lay their hands on the Levites . 11 And Aaron must offer the Levites before Jehovah as a wave offering from the Israelites , and they will carry out the service of Jehovah .

So they agreed to meet together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him . 12 When they saw him from a distance , they did not recognize him . They began to weep loudly and to rip their garments apart , and they threw dust into the air and onto their heads . 13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights . No one said a word to him , for they saw that his pain was very great .

10 The next day a bad spirit from God gripped Saul , and he started to act strangely inside the house , while David was playing music on the harp as on other occasions . Saul had a spear in his hand , 11 and he hurled the spear , saying to himself : ‘ I will pin David to the wall ! ’ But David escaped from him twice . 12 Then Saul was afraid of David because Jehovah was with him but had departed from Saul . 13 So Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as chief of a thousand , and David would lead the army into battle . 14 David continued to have success in all he did , and Jehovah was with him . 15 And when Saul saw that he was very successful , he became afraid of him . 16 But all Israel and Judah loved David , because he would lead them in their campaigns .

( Romans 6 :19 ; 12 :1 ; 2 Corinthians 7 :1 ) We can not worship Jehovah , who gave us life , if we do not view life as precious . Even though it may be very hard to stop bad habits , Jehovah will help us if we are making the effort because we view life as precious .
34 At this Peter began to speak , and he said : “ Now I truly understand that God is not partial , 35 but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him . 36 He sent out the word to the sons of Israel to declare to them the good news of peace through Jesus Christ—this one is Lord of all . 37 You know the subject that was talked about throughout all Ju·deʹa , starting from Galʹi·lee after the baptism that John preached : 38 about Jesus who was from Nazʹa·reth , how God anointed him with holy spirit and power , and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil , because God was with him . 39 And we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem ; but they did away with him by hanging him on a stake . 40 God raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest , 41 not to all the people , but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead . 42 Also , he ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the one decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead . 43 To him all the prophets bear witness , that everyone putting faith in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . ”

18 Similarly , in modern times , Jehovah ’ s Witnesses scour the earth in search of those who yearn to know and serve God . In fact , for the past 17 years in a row , we have spent over one billion hours annually in the preaching and disciple-making work—and we continue with that work . We do so willingly , although the preaching work requires that we sacrifice time , energy , and material resources . Like Jesus , we understand that our loving heavenly Father desires that people acquire the knowledge that leads to everlasting life . ( John 17 :3 ; 1 Tim . 2 :3 , 4 ) Love moves us to help honesthearted ones to come to know and love Jehovah as we do .

On the other hand , the vast majority of humankind is interested in seeking mundane things . People pursue money and the possessions and pleasures that money can buy . Or they put their main energies into furthering their careers . Their way of life reflects a preoccupation with themselves , material things , and pleasures .

22 Truly , we draw ever closer to Jehovah by imitating his justice ! When we uphold his righteous standards , when we share the lifesaving good news with others , and when we choose to focus on the good in others rather than looking for their faults , we are displaying godly justice . Elders , when you protect the cleanness of the congregation , when you offer upbuilding Scriptural counsel , when you make impartial decisions , and when you encourage downhearted ones , you are reflecting godly justice . How it must delight Jehovah ’ s heart to look down from the heavens and see his people trying their best to “ exercise justice ” in walking with their God !
19 For instance , a man tells his boss or fellow workers that he can not be at work the next day or that he must leave early because he has a “ medical ” appointment . In fact , his “ medical ” appointment is merely a brief stop at a pharmacy or a quick visit to the doctor ’ s office to pay a bill . His real reason for not being at work is so that he can get a head start on a trip or so that he can take his family to the beach . There may have been a grain of truth in his mentioning a “ medical ” appointment , but would you say that he was being honest ? Or was he being deceptive ? You may know of similar instances of deliberate deception . Perhaps this is done to avoid punishment or to profit at others ’ expense . Even if no outright lie is told , what of God ’ s direction : “ You must not deceive ” ? Think , too , of Romans 6 :19 , which says : “ Present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness . ”

He truly does have the “ mildness that belongs to wisdom . ”

10 Was Jesus upset that his privacy was disturbed ? Not at all ! His heart was touched by the sight of this crowd , numbering in the thousands , who awaited him . Mark wrote : “ He saw a great crowd , but he was moved with pity for them , because they were as sheep without a shepherd . And he started to teach them many things . ” Jesus saw these people as individuals having spiritual needs . They were like sheep straying helplessly , having no shepherd to guide or protect them . Jesus knew that the common people were neglected by the coldhearted religious leaders , who were supposed to be caring shepherds . ( John 7 :47-49 ) His heart went out to the people , so he began teaching them “ about the kingdom of God . ” ( Luke 9 :11 ) Notice that Jesus was moved with pity for the people even before seeing their reaction to what he would teach . In other words , tender compassion was , not the result of his teaching the crowd , but rather the motive for his doing so .

How did Rachel find the emotional and physical strength to continue battling against circumstances that were discouraging but completely beyond her control ? She never gave up hope . Rather , she kept contending by praying with more intensity . Jehovah heard Rachel ’ s heartfelt supplications , and she was eventually blessed with children .

To Christians living in Rome , he wrote : “ I am longing to see you , that I may impart some spiritual gift to you for you to be made firm ; or , rather , that we may have an interchange of encouragement by one another ’ s faith , both yours and mine . ” ( Rom . 1 :11 , 12 ) Yes , Paul , who gave outstanding encouragement to others , at times needed to be built up himself .—Read Romans 15 :30-32 .

4 The Bible Students understood that it was not enough for them to inform relatives , close friends , and church members of their stand on false religion . The whole world needed to see Babylon the Great for what it is—a religious prostitute ! Accordingly , between December 1917 and early 1918 , the few thousand Bible Students zealously distributed 10 ,000 ,000 copies of a tract featuring the subject “ The Fall of Babylon ” —a hard-hitting indictment of Christendom . As you can imagine , the clergy were furious ; but undeterred , the Bible Students kept right on with this important work . They were determined to obey “ God as ruler rather than men . ” ( Acts 5 :29 ) What can we conclude ? That far from becoming enslaved to Babylon the Great during the war , these Christian men and women were breaking free from its influence and were helping others to do so .

Humans were created “ in God ’ s image . ” ( Gen . 1 :27 ) Thus , most of them exhibit some godly qualities , though to differing degrees . Humans are capable of showing one another love , kindness , and compassion . Having been created with a conscience , people normally have an inborn sense—albeit at times inaccurate or distorted—that alerts them to what is right or wrong , honest or dishonest , appropriate or inappropriate . ( Rom . 2 :14 , 15 ) Most people are drawn to things that are clean and beautiful . Generally , they want to live with others in peace . Whether they realize it or not , they reflect to some extent Jehovah ’ s glory , and for this reason , they deserve a measure of honor and respect . However , balance is needed in determining what kind of honor should be rendered to other humans and to what extent . w17 .03 1 :5 , 6

These articles explain when God ’ s people came into Babylonian captivity and what efforts anointed Christians made in the late 1800 ’ s to understand Jehovah ’ s Word correctly . We will also consider the firm stand the Bible Students took regarding Babylon the Great , and we will learn when the Babylonian captivity ended .
12 When Adam and Eve were created , they were perfect , and it was God ’ s purpose for the earth to be filled with their offspring , all enjoying perfection in mind and body . That purpose will come to glorious reality under the rule of the Kingdom . This requires the removal of all the effects of sin , and to that end , Christ serves not only as King but also as High Priest . Patiently , he will help his obedient subjects to benefit from the sin-atoning value of the sacrifice of his own human life .

What effect did God ’ s Word have on the men who took the lead ? Consider the example of King Josiah . After a document containing the Mosaic Law was found , Josiah ’ s secretary began to read it to him . Guided by God ’ s Word , Josiah began a vigorous campaign against idolatry and arranged an unprecedented celebration of the Passover . ( 2 Ki . 22 :11 ; 23 :1-23 ) Because Josiah and other faithful leaders were guided by God ’ s Word , they were willing to adjust and clarify the direction they gave to God ’ s people . Those changes brought God ’ s ancient people into harmony with his will . However , not all the kings who ruled God ’ s ancient people followed God ’ s instructions . In some cases , Jehovah disciplined or replaced those leaders . ( 1 Sam . 13 :13 , 14 ) In his own due time , he appointed someone who would be superior to any of the men he had used thus far . w17 .02 3 :11 , 12 , 14

Secular history provides ample evidence that the early Christians remained politically neutral and refrained from warfare . Says the book The Beginnings of Christianity : “ The founders of Christianity guarded with sedulous care against the development of anything like a disposition to interfere directly with the established political order . ” Similarly , the book On the Road to Civilization notes : “ Early Christianity was little understood and was regarded with little favor by those who ruled the pagan world . . . . Christians refused to share certain duties of Roman citizens . . . . They would not hold political office . ”

At last , my husband will tolerate me , for I have borne him six sons . ” So she named him Zebʹu·lun . 21 Afterward she bore a daughter and named her Diʹnah .

You might think that this was a simple choice because it is always wise and beneficial to serve Jehovah . In fact , no reasonable person should be attracted to or attached to Baal . Still , those Israelites were “ limping between two different opinions . ” Wisely , Elijah urged them to choose the superior way of worship—the worship of Jehovah . Why might it have been so difficult for those Israelites to make a wise decision ? First , they had basically lost faith in Jehovah and refused to listen to his voice . They had not built a foundation of accurate knowledge or godly wisdom ; nor did they trust in Jehovah . Acting in accord with accurate knowledge would have helped them to make wise decisions . ( Ps . 25 :12 ) Moreover , the people in the land who were not worshippers of Jehovah influenced the Israelites ’ thinking , moving them to follow that pagan crowd . Jehovah had long before warned that such a thing could happen .—Ex . 23 :2 . w17 .03 2 :6 , 7

The very first words of the Bible make this simple but profound statement : “ In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . ” ( Gen . 1 :1 ) It is true that we have only a little understanding of the many things God created , such as space , light , and gravity , and we have seen only a small fraction of the universe . ( Eccl . 3 :11 ) Yet , Jehovah has revealed to us his purpose for the earth and for mankind . The earth was to be an ideal home for men and women created in God ’ s image . ( Gen . 1 :26 ) They would be his children , and Jehovah would be their Father . As explained in the third chapter of Genesis , Jehovah ’ s purpose encountered a challenge . ( Gen . 3 :1-7 ) However , that challenge was by no means insurmountable . No one can stand in Jehovah ’ s way . ( Isa . 46 :10 ; 55 :11 ) Therefore , we can be certain that Jehovah ’ s original purpose will be fulfilled exactly on time ! w17 .02 1 :1 , 2
19 And the former exiles held the Passover on the 14th day of the first month . 20 The priests and the Levites , without exception , had cleansed themselves , so they were all clean ; they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice for all the former exiles , for their fellow priests , and for themselves . 21 Then the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate of it , along with everyone who had joined them and had separated himself from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to worship Jehovah the God of Israel . 22 They also joyfully held the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days , for Jehovah caused them to rejoice and he had made the heart of the king of As·syrʹi·a favorable toward them , so that he supported them in the work of the house of the true God , the God of Israel .

But Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him . 33 At this he turned , looked at his disciples , and rebuked Peter , saying : “ Get behind me , Satan ! because you think , not God ’ s thoughts , but those of men . ”

In another part of this same prophecy about the last days , Jesus gives more details about the judgment that will be pronounced at this time . We find that information in the parable of the sheep and the goats . ( Read Matthew 25 :31-33 , 46 . ) Loyal supporters of God ’ s Kingdom will be judged as “ sheep ” and will “ lift up [ their ] heads , ” realizing that their “ deliverance is getting near . ” ( Luke 21 :28 ) However , Kingdom opposers will be judged as “ goats ” and will “ beat themselves in grief , ” realizing that “ everlasting cutting-off ” awaits them .—Matt . 24 :30 ; Rev . 1 :7 .

Review Discussion
11 As Jesus said , love for God involves our whole heart , mind , soul , and strength . ( Mark 12 :30 ) Such love emanates from the heart , involving our feelings , desires , and inmost thoughts , and we fervently desire to please Jehovah . We also love with our mind . Our devotion is not blind ; we have come to know Jehovah—his qualities , standards , and purposes . We use our soul , our whole being and the life we possess , to serve and praise him . And we use our strength to that end as well .

5 On the final night of his earthly life , Jesus told his followers : “ I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , that you also love one another . By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ” ( John 13 :34 , 35 ) “ Just as I have loved you ” —yes , we are commanded to show the kind of love that Jesus displayed . In Chapter 29 , we noted that Jesus set a superb example in showing self-sacrificing love , putting the needs and interests of others ahead of self . We too are to display unselfish love , and we are to do it so plainly that our love is evident even to those outside the Christian congregation . Indeed , self-sacrificing brotherly love is the mark by which we are identified as true followers of Christ .

What if your listener does not view the Bible as authoritative ? Note what the apostle Paul did in his speech on the Areopagus , as recorded at Acts 17 :22-31 . He shared Scriptural truths without directly quoting from the Bible . Where necessary , you can do the same . In some places you may have to have several discussions with a person before making direct reference to the Bible . When you do introduce the Bible , you may be wise at first simply to offer some reasons why it is worthy of consideration rather than state firmly that it is God ’ s Word . Your aim , however , should be to give a clear witness about God ’ s purpose and , in time , to let your listener see for himself what the Bible says . The Bible is far more persuasive than anything that we personally might say .—Heb . 4 :12 .
22 The most important work we have is serving Jehovah and preaching the good news to others . ( Matthew 24 :14 ; 28 :19 , 20 ) Like Jesus , we want to do all we can in this work . Some have moved to serve where there is a greater need for preachers . Others are learning a foreign language so that they can preach to people who speak that language . Talk with those who have done these things , and ask them about it . They will tell you that their lives have become happier and more meaningful .—Read Proverbs 10 :22 .
Jehovah always supports his faithful servants , even though he may allow them to wait for privileges or a favorable change of circumstances . He promised Abraham a son , but the patriarch had to exercise faith and patience . ( Heb . 6 :12-15 ) Although he waited years for Isaac ’ s birth , Abraham did not lose heart , and Jehovah did not disappoint him . ( Gen . 15 :3 , 4 ; 21 :5 ) Waiting is not easy . ( Prov . 13 :12 ) If we were to brood over disappointments , we could become very discouraged . Instead , it is wise to use our time to improve our spiritual qualifications . By reading God ’ s Word and meditating on it , we can develop wisdom , insight , good judgment , knowledge , thinking ability , and soundness of mind . Daily , we face issues involving entertainment , dress and grooming , managing money , and getting along with others . By applying what we learn from the Bible , we can make decisions that please Jehovah . w16 .08 3 :9-11
17 Further , each mate needs to be ready to care for the special needs of the other . ( Read Philippians 2 :4 . ) Paul wrote : “ Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself ; on the other hand , the wife should have deep respect for her husband . ” Under divine inspiration , Paul saw that the man has a special need to sense his wife ’ s deep respect for him . And the woman has a special need to feel loved by her husband .—Ephesians 5 :21-33 .
Josephus was not a Christian author . He was a Jewish historian ; hence , much of the controversy centers on the designation of Jesus as being “ the Christ . ” On analysis , Bardet asserted that this title corresponds “ in every respect to the Greek usage of employing the [ definite ] article for the names of people . ” Bardet added that from a Judeo-Christian perspective , “ not only is the use of the term Christos by Josephus not an impossibility ” but it is a clue that “ critics have in general been greatly wrong to overlook . ”

Consequently , in 1949 Italy became a member of NATO . The Marshall Plan helped to revive the Italian economy which , until the late 1960s , enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the "Economic Miracle" . In 1957 , Italy was a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC) , which became the European Union (EU) in 1993 .

20 But Am·a·ziʹah did not listen , for this was from the true God to give them into the hand of the enemy , because they had followed the gods of Eʹdom . 21 So King Je·hoʹash of Israel went up , and he and King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah confronted each other in battle at Beth-sheʹmesh , which belongs to Judah . 22 Judah was defeated by Israel , so each one fled to his home . 23 King Je·hoʹash of Israel captured King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah , son of Je·hoʹash son of Je·hoʹa·haz , at Beth-sheʹmesh . Then he brought him to Jerusalem and made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Eʹphra·im to the Corner Gate , 400 cubits . 24 He took all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were found in the house of the true God with Oʹbed-eʹdom and in the treasuries of the king ’ s house , as well as hostages . Then he returned to Sa·marʹi·a .

11 Moral cleanness . To keep morally clean includes avoiding sexual immorality of any kind . ( Read Ephesians 5 :5 . ) It is vital that we stay morally clean . As we will see in the next chapter of this book , to remain in God ’ s love , we must “ flee from sexual immorality . ” Those who unrepentantly practice sexual immorality “ will not inherit God ’ s Kingdom . ” ( 1 Corinthians 6 :9 , 10 , 18 ) In God ’ s eyes , such ones are among those who are “ disgusting in their filth . ” If they fail to keep morally clean , “ their portion will be . . . the second death . ” —Revelation 21 :8 .

8 When the Phi·lisʹtines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel , all the Phi·lisʹtines came up to search for David . When David heard about it , he went out against them . 9 Then the Phi·lisʹtines came in and kept making raids in the Valley of Rephʹa·im . 10 David inquired of God , saying : “ Should I go up against the Phi·lisʹtines ? Will you give them into my hand ? ” At this Jehovah said to him : “ Go up , and I will surely give them into your hand . ” 11 So David went up to Baʹal-pe·raʹzim , and he struck them down there . At that David said : “ The true God has broken through my enemies by my hand , like a breach made by waters . ” That is why they named that place Baʹal-pe·raʹzim . 12 The Phi·lisʹtines abandoned their gods there , and when David gave the order , these were burned in the fire .

Now let your hand drop . ” Jehovah ’ s angel was close to the threshing floor of A·rauʹnah the Jebʹu·site .

2 In the decades leading up to World War I , Charles Taze Russell and his associates realized that the organizations of Christendom were not teaching Bible truth . Accordingly , they resolved to have nothing to do with false religion as they understood it . As early as November of 1879 , Zion ’ s Watch Tower straightforwardly set out their Scriptural position by stating : “ Every church claiming to be a chaste virgin espoused to Christ , but in reality united to and supported by the world ( beast ) we must condemn as being in scripture language a harlot church , ” a reference to Babylon the Great .—Read Revelation 17 :1 , 2 .

3 Jeremiah said to them : “ This is what you should say to Zed·e·kiʹah , 4 ‘ This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : “ Here I am turning around against you the weapons of war that are in your own hands , with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chal·deʹans who are outside the wall besieging you . And I will gather them into the middle of this city . 5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm , with anger and wrath and great indignation . 6 I will strike the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast . By a great pestilence they will die . ” ’
Our faith in Jehovah ’ s ability to read hearts and to draw to himself those whom he chooses should prevent us from judging others , both in our territory and in our congregation . ( John 6 :44 ) Accepting Jehovah as our Potter can affect our attitude toward fellow believers . ( Isa . 64 :8 ) Do you see your brothers and sisters as God does—not as a finished product , but as a work in progress ? He can see the inner person as well as the kind of person one can become in his capable hands . Hence , Jehovah takes a positive view of people and does not focus on temporary imperfections . ( Ps . 130 :3 ) We can imitate him by seeing his servants in a positive light . In fact , we can work along with our Potter by supporting our brothers and sisters as they strive to make spiritual advancement . ( 1 Thess . 5 :14 , 15 ) As “ gifts in men , ” the elders ought to take the lead in this regard .—Eph . 4 :8 , 11-13 . w16 .06 1 :4-6
You can use common objects to build faith in God and in creation ( See paragraph 10 )
The disciples know that the man has no invisible soul that existed before he was born , yet they may wonder whether a person might sin while in his mother ’ s womb . Jesus answers : “ Neither this man sinned nor his parents , but it was so that the works of God might be made manifest in his case . ” ( John 9 :3 ) So neither this man nor his parents were guilty of a specific error or sin that caused his blindness . Rather , as a result of Adam ’ s sin , all humans are born imperfect and are subject to defects , such as blindness . But the man ’ s blindness provides an opportunity for Jesus to make manifest the works of God , as he has done at other times in healing people of their sicknesses .

14 News of faithfulness on the part of those we have helped in the past can be a real source of encouragement , as it was for the apostle John , who wrote : “ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ( 3 John 4 ) Many pioneers can attest to how encouraging it is for them to learn that some of those they helped into the truth years ago are staying faithful and perhaps are even serving as pioneers . Simply reminding a discouraged pioneer of past joys can be a real source of comfort .

14 So the Word became flesh and resided among us , and we had a view of his glory , a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father ; and he was full of divine favor and truth . 15 ( John bore witness about him , yes , he cried out : “ This was the one of whom I said , ‘ The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me , for he existed before me . ’ ” ) 16 For we all received from his fullness , even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness . 17 Because the Law was given through Moses , the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ . 18 No man has seen God at any time ; the only-begotten god who is at the Father ’ s side is the one who has explained Him .
12 Naomi related to Ruth a plan of action . We might imagine the young woman ’ s eyes widening as her mother-in-law spoke . Israel ’ s Law was still new to Ruth , and many of its customs were still quite foreign to her . Even so , she held Naomi in such high regard that she listened carefully to every word . What Naomi advised her to do might have seemed awkward or embarrassing—even potentially humiliating—yet Ruth agreed . She meekly said : “ All that you say to me I shall do . ” —Ruth 3 :5 .
Me·thuʹse·lah ,
Furthermore , Noah had deep religious beliefs , and he did not keep them to himself . The Bible says that he was “ a preacher of righteousness . ” ( 2 Peter 2 :5 ) Undoubtedly , Noah expected opposition . His great-grandfather Enoch was a righteous man who foretold that God would execute judgment against the wicked . Evidently , this brought persecution against Enoch , though God did not permit his opposers to kill him . ( Genesis 5 :18 , 21-24 ; Hebrews 11 :5 ; 12 :1 ; Jude 14 , 15 ) With Satan , the demons , the Nephilim , and most of the people either indifferent or opposed to him , Noah needed courage as well as faith in Jehovah ’ s ability to safeguard him .
“ FEW and distressing the days of the years of my life have proved , ” said the patriarch Jacob . ( Genesis 47 :9 ) Similarly , Job stated that man “ is short-lived and glutted with agitation . ” ( Job 14 :1 ) Like them , most of us have experienced difficulties , injustices , even tragedies . Yet , our being born was no injustice on God ’ s part . True , we do not have the perfection of mind and body and the Paradise home that Adam and Eve originally had . But what if Jehovah had immediately executed them when they rebelled ? While there would not have been any sickness , sorrow , or death , there would not have been a human race either . We would not have been born . Mercifully , God allowed Adam and Eve time to bring forth children , even though these inherited imperfection . And through Christ , Jehovah made provision for us to get back what Adam had lost—everlasting life on a paradise earth .—John 10 :10 ; Romans 5 :12 .

3 How long will you assault a man in order to murder him ?
13 We need to follow the Bible-based direction we receive from the elders . These loyal shepherds within God ’ s organization are guided by “ wholesome , ” or “ healthful ; beneficial , ” instruction found in God ’ s own Book . ( 1 Tim . 6 :3 ; ftn . ) Recall Paul ’ s counsel regarding disorderly ones in the congregation . Some individuals were ‘ not working at all but were meddling with what did not concern them . ’ They were evidently admonished by the elders but persisted in disregarding the counsel . How was the congregation to deal with such a person ? Paul directed : “ Keep this one marked and stop associating with him . ” That counsel was balanced with the caution not to treat such a person as an enemy . ( 2 Thess . 3 :11-15 ) Today , elders may give a warning talk about someone ’ s persisting in a course that reflects badly on the congregation , such as dating an unbeliever . ( 1 Cor . 7 :39 ) How do you react when the elders find it necessary to give such a talk ? If you are aware of the situation described in the talk , will you take care to avoid socializing with such an individual ? Your loving concern and firm stand may move the person to abandon a disorderly course . [ 1 ]

15 Jehovah spoke further to Moses , saying : 2 “ Speak to the Israelites and say to them , ‘ When you eventually come into the land that I am giving you to dwell in 3 and you make an offering by fire to Jehovah from the herd or from the flock—whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or a voluntary offering or an offering during your seasonal festivals , in order to make a pleasing aroma to Jehovah— 4 the one presenting his offering must also present to Jehovah a grain offering of fine flour , a tenth of an eʹphah , mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil . 5 You should also offer wine as a drink offering , a fourth of a hin , together with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice of each male lamb . 6 Or for a ram , you should make a grain offering of two tenths of an eʹphah measure of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil . 7 And you should present wine as a drink offering , a third of a hin , as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah .
Then Jehovah sent the light ,

Jesus Christ identified another reason for being cautious of adopting popular opinion as a guide to right and wrong . He exposed Satan as “ the ruler of the world . ” ( John 14 :30 ; Luke 4 :6 ) Satan uses his position to mislead “ the entire inhabited earth . ” ( Revelation 12 :9 ) Therefore , if you set your standards of right and wrong purely by what is popular , you might be adopting Satan ’ s view of morality , and that would obviously be disastrous .
4 Jehovah is the Supreme Worker . Genesis 1 :1 states : “ In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . ” When God completed his creative work involving the earth , he pronounced the results “ very good . ” ( Genesis 1 :31 ) In other words , he was fully satisfied with all his earthly work . Jehovah , “ the happy God , ” no doubt found great joy in being a productive worker .—1 Timothy 1 :11 .

Then God saw that it was good . 19 And there was evening and there was morning , a fourth day .

2 Jesus ’ parable reminds us of one of Jehovah ’ s qualities that is often mentioned in the Bible—his “ undeserved kindness . ” [ 1 ] ( Read 2 Corinthians 6 :1 . ) The workers who had labored only one hour did not seem to merit receiving the full wage , but the owner of the vineyard showed them extraordinary kindness . Regarding the word for “ undeserved kindness , ” which is translated “ grace ” in many Bible versions , one scholar wrote : “ The whole basic idea of the word is that of a free and undeserved gift , of something given to a man unearned and unmerited . ”
13 But he in answer said to one of them , Friend , I do you no wrong : did you not make an agreement with me for a penny ?
6 Jehovah then said this to Moses : 7 “ The daughters of Ze·loʹphe·had are correct . You should by all means give them the possession as an inheritance among their father ’ s brothers and transfer their father ’ s inheritance to them . 8 And tell the Israelites , ‘ If a man dies without having a son , you must then cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter . 9 And if he has no daughter , you will give his inheritance to his brothers . 10 And if he has no brothers , you will give his inheritance to his father ’ s brothers . 11 And if his father has no brothers , you will give his inheritance to the closest blood relative in his family , and he will take possession of it . This will serve as a statute by judicial decision for the Israelites , just as Jehovah has commanded Moses . ’ ”

9 Read Philippians 2 :4 . Why do Christians need to consider how their attire affects fellow worshippers ? One reason is that God ’ s people work hard to apply the Bible ’ s admonition : “ Deaden , therefore , your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality , uncleanness , uncontrolled sexual passion . ” ( Col . 3 :2 , 5 ) We would not want to make it difficult for fellow believers to heed that counsel . Brothers and sisters who have given up a sexually loose lifestyle may still be fighting sinful leanings . ( 1 Cor . 6 :9 , 10 ) We would not want to make their fight harder , would we ?
23 In this chapter concluding the section on love , we have discussed how we can show love for one another . But in view of the many ways in which we benefit from Jehovah ’ s love—as well as from his power , justice , and wisdom—we do well to ask , ‘ How can I show Jehovah that I truly love him ? ’ That question will be considered in our final chapter .

10 Being encouraging is not the exclusive responsibility of the elders . Paul exhorted all Christians to speak “ what is good for building up as the need may be , to impart what is beneficial ” to others . ( Eph . 4 :29 ) Each of us should be alert to observe “ the need ” that others have . Paul counseled Hebrew Christians : “ Strengthen the hands that hang down and the feeble knees , and keep making straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but , rather , may be healed . ” ( Heb . 12 :12 , 13 ) All of us , including young ones , can build one another up by words of encouragement .

2 Before God ’ s firstborn Son was miraculously conceived as a human , scores of inspired prophecies were recorded about him . The apostle Peter testified to Cornelius : “ To him all the prophets bear witness . ” ( Acts 10 :43 ) The role of Jesus was featured in the Bible to such an extent that an angel told the apostle John : “ The bearing witness to Jesus is what inspires prophesying . ” ( Revelation 19 :10 ) Those prophecies clearly identified him as the Messiah . They drew attention to various roles he would play in fulfilling God ’ s purposes . All of this should be of keen interest to us today .

Is having free will with limits real freedom ? Yes , it is ! Why can we say that ? Limitations put on people ’ s freedom can protect them . For example , we may exercise our freedom of choice to drive to a distant city . However , would we feel safe traveling on highways where there were no traffic laws , where everyone was free to decide how fast or on which side of the road to drive ? Obviously not . Limits are necessary in order for all to enjoy the blessings of true freedom . To illustrate further the wisdom of using our free will within the boundaries set by Jehovah , consider the case of Adam . He chose to overstep his God-ordained boundaries by eating the forbidden fruit . This gross misuse of free will resulted in millenniums of suffering and pain for Adam ’ s descendants . ( Rom . 5 :12 ) Knowing the consequences of Adam ’ s decision should move us to use our freedom responsibly and within the limits set by Jehovah . w17 .01 2 :6 , 8

( Galatians 6 :4 ) It is with great subtlety that he reads our hearts , and he values the good—even small measures of it .

18 In truth , feelings of guilt can be the conscience ’ s way of telling us that we have done wrong . When such feelings move a sinner to repent , even the worst of sins may be forgiven . King David , for example , became guilty of grave wrongdoing but was forgiven largely because of his sincere repentance . His hatred of his wrong course and his determination to obey Jehovah ’ s laws from then on led him to see firsthand that Jehovah is “ good and ready to forgive . ” ( Psalm 51 :1-19 ; 86 :5 ) What , though , if intense feelings of guilt and shame persist after we have repented and have received forgiveness ?

29 “ You will overlay the panel frames with gold , and you will make their rings of gold as holders for the bars , and you will overlay the bars with gold . 30 You must set up the tabernacle according to its plan that you were shown in the mountain .
10 Similarly , Christians guard against forming relationships with those who might weaken their faith . ( 1 Corinthians 15 :33 ) We are admonished : “ Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers , ” those who are no part of the Christian congregation . ( 2 Corinthians 6 :14 ) Further , Christians are counseled to marry “ only in the Lord . ” ( 1 Corinthians 7 :39 ) Yet , never should we be disdainful of those who do not share our belief in Jehovah . Christ died for sinners , and many who once practiced vile things changed their ways and became reconciled to God .—Romans 5 :8 ; 1 Corinthians 6 :9-11 .

5 The supreme example of courage and boldness was , of course , Jesus Christ . Still , since the beginning of human history , boldness has always been needed by all of those loyal to Jehovah . Why so ? Following the rebellion in Eden , Jehovah foretold that there would be enmity between those who served God and those who served Satan . ( Gen . 3 :15 ) This enmity quickly became evident when Abel , a righteous man , was killed by his brother . Later , enmity was directed against Enoch , another faithful man who lived before the Flood . He prophesied that God would come with His holy myriads to execute judgment against the ungodly . ( Jude 14 , 15 ) This message was certainly not a popular one . People hated Enoch and evidently would have murdered him had Jehovah not cut his life short . What boldness Enoch displayed ! —Gen . 5 :21-24 .

13 At times , a serious situation may arise in the congregation , and we will need to be especially careful . It could be that a brother or a sister is doing things that the Bible says are wrong . Or someone may develop a complaining attitude that could damage the congregation . This does not surprise us , because even in the first century , there were problems in the congregation at times . In fact , the apostle Paul warned Christians back then : “ Do not be misled . Bad associations spoil useful habits . ” ( 1 Corinthians 15 :12 , 33 ) Paul also warned Timothy to be careful about whom he chose to be his close friends . We should do the same today .—Read 2 Timothy 2 :20-22 .

14 Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers . For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have ? Or what sharing does light have with darkness ? 15 Further , what harmony is there between Christ and Beʹli·al ? Or what does a believer share in common with an unbeliever ? 16 And what agreement does God ’ s temple have with idols ? For we are a temple of a living God ; just as God said : “ I will reside among them and walk among them , and I will be their God , and they will be my people . ” 17 “ ‘ Therefore , get out from among them , and separate yourselves , ’ says Jehovah , ‘ and quit touching the unclean thing ’ ” ; “ ‘ and I will take you in . ’ ” 18 “ ‘ And I will become a father to you , and you will become sons and daughters to me , ’ says Jehovah , the Almighty . ”

Those who support the worldwide work of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses can be sure that their donations are used properly and effectively . Are you in a position to help bring relief to your brothers in need ? Do you desire to support the disciple-making work ?

30 Then Jephʹthah made a vow to Jehovah and said : “ If you give the Amʹmon·ites into my hand , 31 then whoever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Amʹmon·ites will become Jehovah ’ s , and I will offer that one up as a burnt offering . ”

Then Jesus expresses confidence in his Father , which these Jews lack : “ After you have lifted up the Son of man , then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing of my own initiative ; but just as the Father taught me , I speak these things . And the One who sent me is with me ; he did not abandon me to myself , because I always do the things pleasing to him . ” —John 8 :28 , 29 .
22 I , Terʹtius , who have done the writing of this letter , greet you in the Lord .
13 So I kept men posted at the lowest parts of the space behind the wall at the exposed places , and I posted them by families with their swords , their lances , and their bows . 14 When I saw their fear , I immediately rose and said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people : “ Do not be afraid of them . Remember Jehovah , who is great and awe-inspiring ; and fight for your brothers , your sons and daughters , your wives and homes . ”
26 I write you these things about those who are trying to mislead you . 27 And as for you , the anointing that you received from him remains in you , and you do not need anyone to be teaching you ; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie . Just as it has taught you , remain in union with him . 28 So now , little children , remain in union with him , so that when he is made manifest we may have freeness of speech and not shrink away from him in shame at his presence . 29 If you know that he is righteous , you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from him .
This arrangement does not make a wife inferior to her husband . It actually helps her to fulfill the role God had in mind for a wife when he said : “ It is not good for the man [ Adam ] to continue to be alone . I am going to make a helper for him , as a complement of him . ” ( Gen . 2 :18 ) Just as Christ , the “ head of the congregation , ” displays love , a Christian husband is to exercise loving headship . When he does so , his wife feels secure and finds satisfaction in being respectful , supportive , and submissive . Imitating Jesus ’ example requires that his followers love one another just as he loved them . ( John 13 :34 , 35 ; 15 :12 , 13 ; Eph . 5 :25 ) Marital love shown by Christians should therefore be so strong that either mate would be willing , if necessary , to die for the other . w16 .08 2 :3 , 4

2 Today , we have every reason to believe that the “ great and very awe-inspiring ” day of Jehovah is near . ( Joel 2 :11 ) The prophet Zephaniah said : “ The great day of Jehovah is near ! It is near and it is approaching very quickly ! ” ( Zeph . 1 :14 ) That prophetic warning also applies to our time . In view of the proximity of Jehovah ’ s day , Paul tells us to “ be concerned about one another so as to incite to love and fine works . ” ( Heb . 10 :24 , ftn . ) We should , therefore , be increasingly interested in our brothers , so that we can encourage them whenever needed .

YOU walk into your Kingdom Hall and hardly recognize the place . You have always been proud of this building . You may even have happy memories of helping in its construction some years ago . But in a way you are even prouder now , for the Kingdom Hall has been transformed temporarily into a relief center . After a recent storm brought floods and devastation to your region , the Branch Committee quickly organized a way for the victims of the disaster to get food , clothing , clean water , and other help . Donated relief supplies are neatly arranged . Brothers and sisters are filing in , getting what they need and , in many cases , wiping tears of joy from their eyes .

But you did not want it . 38 Look !

Cleanness is important to Jehovah .
John 13 :35
7 Do not be misled : God is not one to be mocked . For whatever a person is sowing , this he will also reap ; 8 because the one sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh , but the one sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit . 9 So let us not give up in doing what is fine , for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out . 10 So , then , as long as we have the opportunity , let us work what is good toward all , but especially toward those related to us in the faith .
But for me , for a large part of my life , I feared myself .

Of course , God ’ s Word does not spell out every arrangement or procedure needed to help the congregation function . Yet , the Bible does say : “ Let all things take place decently and by arrangement . ” ( 1 Corinthians 14 :40 ) The Governing Body obeys this direction by putting in place various helpful procedures and guidelines that ensure the smooth and orderly operation of the congregation . Responsible Christian men do their part by setting an example of obedience as they put such arrangements into effect . They also show themselves “ reasonable , ready to obey ” those placed in oversight . ( James 3 :17 ) Thus , each group , congregation , circuit , and country is blessed with a united , orderly body of believers who reflect well on the happy God .—1 Corinthians 14 :33 ; 1 Timothy 1 :11 .

12 You may find yourself surprised at times by the degree to which Christian consciences differ . One person finds a practice or custom objectionable ; another enjoys it and sees no basis for condemning it . In the matter of social drinking , for example , one finds delight in having a drink with a few friends as they relax together for an evening ; another is troubled by the practice . Why are there such differences , and how should they affect our decisions ?

2 It might have appeared that Jehovah ’ s purpose for the seventh day had been thrown hopelessly off track . That day , like the six that preceded it , was to be thousands of years long . Jehovah had pronounced it sacred , and it would ultimately see the whole earth made into a paradise filled with a perfect family of mankind . ( Genesis 1 :28 ; 2 :3 ) But after the catastrophic rebellion , how could such a thing ever come about ? What would God do ? Here was a dramatic test of Jehovah ’ s wisdom—perhaps the ultimate test .

13 Even while in prison , the eight men held steadfastly to the Scriptures as they understood them . In a petition for clemency addressed to the president of the United States , they wrote : “ The Lord ’ s will is as announced in the Scriptures , ‘ Thou shalt not kill , ’ and therefore any member of the [ International Bible Students ] Association so consecrated unto the Lord who would willingly violate his covenant of consecration would forfeit for himself God ’ s favor , even to his complete destruction . Hence such members could not willingly and conscientiously engage in the taking of the life of human beings . ” Bold words those ! Clearly , the brothers had no intention of compromising !
David , the shepherd and king , certainly had good friends . Jonathan is one of those friends who may come to mind . ( 1 Sam . 18 :1 ) But David had other friends , such as the prophet Nathan . The Bible does not specify when their friendship began . Yet , at one point David confided in Nathan as you might confide in a friend . David desired to build a house for Jehovah . The king must have valued Nathan ’ s opinion as a friend and as a man who had Jehovah ’ s spirit .—2 Sam . 7 :2 , 3 .

12 Eventually a written message came to him from E·liʹjah the prophet , saying : “ This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says , ‘ You have not walked in the ways of your father Je·hoshʹa·phat or in the ways of King Aʹsa of Judah . 13 But you walk in the way of the kings of Israel and cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution like the prostitution of the house of Aʹhab , and you even killed your own brothers , the household of your father , who were better than you . 14 Therefore , Jehovah is dealing a great blow to your people , to your sons , to your wives , and to all your possessions . 15 And you will suffer with many sicknesses , including a disease of your intestines , until your intestines come out because of the disease , day after day . ’ ”
16 , 17 . On the final night of his earthly life , what reassurance did Jesus give his apostles , even though he knew they were going to abandon him ?

23 In the innermost room he made two cherubs of pinewood , each ten cubits high . 24 One wing of the cherub measured five cubits , and the other wing was five cubits . From the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing was ten cubits . 25 The second cherub was also ten cubits . The two cherubs had the same size and shape . 26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits , as was that of the other cherub . 27 Then he put the cherubs inside the inner house . The wings of the cherubs were extended so that the wing of the one cherub reached to one wall and the wing of the other cherub reached to the other wall , and their wings extended toward the middle of the house , so that the wings touched . 28 And he overlaid the cherubs with gold .

6 A person ’ s worship could be contaminated by false religion as it relates to popular holidays . Consider Christmas , for example . Christmas supposedly commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ , and nearly every religion that claims to be Christian celebrates it . Yet , there is no evidence that the first-century disciples of Jesus observed such a holiday . The book Sacred Origins of Profound Things states : “ For two centuries after Christ ’ s birth , no one knew , and few people cared , exactly when he was born . ”

16 Jehovah ’ s goodness involves more than generosity . God told Moses : “ I myself shall cause all my goodness to pass before your face , and I will declare the name of Jehovah before you . ” Later the account says : “ Jehovah went passing by before his face and declaring : ‘ Jehovah , Jehovah , a God merciful and gracious , slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth . ’ ” ( Exodus 33 :19 ; 34 :6 ) So Jehovah ’ s goodness embraces a number of fine qualities . Let us consider just two of these .

13 Jehovah uses the Christian congregation and its overseers to mold us on a personal level . For example , if the elders discern that we are having spiritual problems , they try to help us—but not on the basis of human wisdom . ( Gal . 6 :1 ) Rather , they humbly look to God , asking for insight and wisdom . With our situation in mind , they act on their prayers by doing research in God ’ s Word and in our Christian publications . This can equip them to render help tailored to our needs . If they come to you to offer kind , loving help , such as about your style of dress , will you accept their counsel as an expression of God ’ s love for you ? In doing so , you prove to be like soft clay in Jehovah ’ s hands , ready to be molded to your benefit .

5 The Bible calls Jesus “ the firstborn of all creation . ” ( Colossians 1 :15 ) Just think—Jehovah ’ s Son was in existence before the physical universe . How long , then , were Father and Son together ? Some scientists estimate that the universe is 13 billion years old . Can you even imagine that much time ? To help people grasp the age of the universe as estimated by scientists , one planetarium features a time line 360 feet ( 110 m ) long . As visitors walk along that time line , each step they take represents about 75 million years in the life of the universe . At the end of the time line , all human history is represented by a single mark the thickness of one human hair ! Yet , even if this estimate is correct , that entire time line would not be long enough to represent the life span of Jehovah ’ s Son ! How was he occupied during all those ages ?

They are coming to you , and when you see their ways and their deeds , you will certainly be comforted over the calamity that I brought on Jerusalem , over everything that I did to it . ’ ”

21 Brother Russell and his associates recognized the importance of commemorating the Lord ’ s Evening Meal and knew that it should be observed only once each year . The April 1880 issue of the Watch Tower said : “ It has for several years been the custom of many of us here in Pittsburgh to . . . remember the Passover [ Memorial ] and eat the emblems of our Lord ’ s body and blood . ” Conventions were soon being held in conjunction with the Memorial . The first time records were kept for such an occasion was in 1889 , when 225 attended and 22 were baptized .

37 Now when they heard this , they were stabbed to the heart , and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles : “ Men , brothers , what should we do ? ” 38 Peter said to them : “ Repent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . 39 For the promise is to you and your children , and to all those who are far away , to all those whom Jehovah our God may call to himself . ” 40 And with many other words he gave a thorough witness and kept exhorting them , saying : “ Get saved from this crooked generation . ” 41 So those who gladly accepted his word were baptized , and on that day about 3 ,000 people were added . 42 And they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles , to associating together , to the taking of meals , and to prayers .

10 We can be sure that the Devil will never let his hands drop down in his efforts to stop our Christian activities . He uses lies and threats from governments , religious leaders , and apostates . What is his goal ? It is to cause our hands to slacken in the work of preaching the Kingdom good news . However , Jehovah is able and willing to give us strength by means of his holy spirit . ( 1 Chron . 29 :12 ) It is vital that we draw on that spirit so that we can face any challenge that Satan and his wicked system thrust upon us . ( Ps . 18 :39 ; 1 Cor . 10 :13 ) Also , we can be grateful that we have God ’ s Word , which is a product of holy spirit . Think , too , about the spiritual food based on the Bible that we receive each month . The words of Zechariah 8 :9 , 13 ( read ) were spoken while the temple in Jerusalem was being rebuilt , and those words are very fitting for us .
5 “ ‘ Now if you offer a communion sacrifice to Jehovah , you should sacrifice it in such a way that you gain approval for yourselves . 6 It should be eaten on the day of your sacrifice and on the next day , but what is left over until the third day should be burned in the fire . 7 If , though , any of it is eaten on the third day , it is an offensive thing that will not be accepted with approval . 8 The one eating it will answer for his error because he has profaned a holy thing of Jehovah , and that person must be cut off from his people .

At that time , “ all flesh will , ” in a literal sense , week by week and month by month , “ come in to bow down before , ” or worship , Jehovah throughout eternity . Since meeting together to worship Jehovah will be a permanent feature of our spiritual lives in the new system of things , should we not make regular attendance at our sacred gatherings a permanent feature of our lives now ?

4 A vital point in the issue of sovereignty is this : God did not create humans to live independently of his rulership and be successful . For their benefit he made them dependent on his righteous laws . The prophet Jeremiah acknowledged : “ I well know , O Jehovah , that to earthling man his way does not belong . It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step . Correct me , O Jehovah . ” ( Jeremiah 10 :23 , 24 ) So God ’ s Word urges : “ Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding . ” ( Proverbs 3 :5 ) Just as God made humankind subject to his physical laws to stay alive , he also made moral laws , which if obeyed would make for a harmonious society .

Even some Christians have become blind to its dangers . ( 2 Corinthians 11 :3 ) So , what can we do to protect ourselves ? How can we make sure that we are not being deceived by Satan ’ s tricks ? Let ’ s examine two areas in which we could be tricked : entertainment and medical treatment .
Isa 32 :1 A k . will reign for righteousness
24 But the shameful thing has consumed the toil of our forefathers since our youth ,
Respond when their heart opens wide .
They will see your zeal for your people and be put to shame .
Nor an old man who fails to live out his days .
21 When we show respect in our family , in our congregation , and in other areas of life , our good example may make others want to learn more about Jehovah . And by showing respect to others , we show respect to Jehovah himself . This makes Jehovah happy and shows him that we love him .
They trusted , and you kept rescuing them .

10 One principal way to keep our love for Jehovah strong is stated by Paul himself . He wrote to fellow believers : “ Pray constantly . ” Later he wrote : “ Persevere in prayer . ” ( 1 Thess . 5 :17 ; Rom . 12 :12 ) Communication through prayer is the foundation of a close relationship with God . ( Ps . 86 :3 ) When we take sufficient time to express to Jehovah our deepest thoughts and innermost feelings , we can not help but be drawn closer to our heavenly Father , the “ Hearer of prayer . ” ( Ps . 65 :2 ) In addition , when we discern that Jehovah answers our prayers , our love for him grows . We come to realize ever more that “ Jehovah is near to all those calling on him . ” ( Ps . 145 :18 ) That confidence in Jehovah ’ s loving support will help us to cope with further tests of faith .

18 What of the members of the “ great crowd , ” who will survive “ the great tribulation ” ? They too must prove that they share Jehovah ’ s view of sacred things . In the book of Revelation , they are represented as rendering Jehovah “ sacred service ” in the earthly courtyard of his spiritual temple . They have put faith in Christ ’ s ransom sacrifice , symbolically ‘ washing their robes and making them white in the blood of the Lamb . ’ ( Revelation 7 :9 , 14 , 15 ) This gives them a clean standing before Jehovah and places them under obligation to “ cleanse [ themselves ] of every defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in God ’ s fear . ”
7 Now in the days of Aʹhaz son of Joʹtham son of Uz·ziʹah , the king of Judah , King Reʹzin of Syria and Peʹkah son of Rem·a·liʹah , the king of Israel , came up to wage war against Jerusalem , but he could not capture it . 2 A report was made to the house of David : “ Syria has joined forces with Eʹphra·im . ”
We don 't have to inject anything . We don 't need radiation .
At some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
10 Second , we “ provide well for the needs ” of fellow believers . ( 2 Cor . 9 :12a ) We are eager to meet the immediate needs and to help alleviate the suffering of our brothers and sisters . Why ? Because the members of the Christian congregation form “ one body , ” and “ if one member suffers , all the other members suffer with it . ” ( 1 Cor . 12 :20 , 26 ) Hence , brotherly affection and compassion move numerous brothers and sisters today to drop what they are doing at a moment ’ s notice , gather their tools , and head for disaster-stricken areas to bring relief to fellow believers . ( Jas . 2 :15 , 16 ) For instance , after a tsunami struck Japan in 2011 , the United States branch office sent a letter to Regional Building Committees in the United States , asking if “ a few qualified brothers ” would be available to help with rebuilding Kingdom Halls there . What was the response ? Within weeks , nearly 600 volunteers applied to help—and agreed to fly to Japan at their own expense ! “ We have been overwhelmed with the response , ” noted the United States branch office . When a brother in Japan asked a relief worker from abroad why he had come to help , he was told : “ Our brothers in Japan are part of ‘ our body . ’ We feel their pain and suffering . ” Moved by self-sacrificing love , relief workers have at times even risked their lives to help fellow believers .—1 John 3 :16 .

And Samuel said : “ What has been reserved has been set before you . Eat , because they have reserved it for you for this occasion . For I told them , ‘ I invited guests . ’ ” So Saul ate with Samuel on that day . 25 Then they went down from the high place to the city , and he continued to speak with Saul on the housetop . 26 They rose early , and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the housetop , saying : “ Get ready , so that I may send you away . ” So Saul got ready and both he and Samuel went outside . 27 While they were descending toward the outskirts of the city , Samuel said to Saul : “ Tell the attendant to go on ahead of us , ” so he went on ahead . “ But you , stand still now , so that I may let you hear the word of God . ”

7 Many experiences could be used to illustrate God ’ s acts of compassion . Consider what happened to the family of a 12-year-old lad whom we will call Milan . It was during a time of ethnic strife in the early 1990 ’ s . Milan , his brother , his parents , and a number of other Witnesses were riding on a bus from Bosnia to Serbia . They were on their way to a convention at which Milan ’ s parents intended to get baptized . But at the border , soldiers pulled the family off the bus because of their ethnicity ; yet , they allowed the other brothers to proceed . After holding the family for two days , the officer in charge radioed his superior to ask what should be done with them . The officer was standing right in front of the family , so all heard the response , “ Just take them out and shoot them ! ”

He should not demand payment from his neighbor or his brother , for it will be proclaimed a release to Jehovah . 3 You may demand payment from the foreigner , but you should release your claim on whatever your brother owes you . 4 However , no one among you should become poor , for Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , 5 but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today . 6 For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you , and you will lend to many nations , but you will not need to borrow ; and you will dominate many nations , but they will not dominate you .

She has gone up on every high mountain and underneath every luxuriant tree to commit prostitution . 7 Even after she did all these things , I kept telling her to return to me , but she did not return ; and Judah kept watching her treacherous sister . 8 When I saw that , I sent unfaithful Israel away with a full certificate of divorce because of her adultery . But her treacherous sister Judah did not become afraid ; she too went out and committed prostitution . 9 She took her prostitution lightly , and she kept polluting the land and committing adultery with stones and with trees . 10 Despite all this , her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart , only in pretense , ’ declares Jehovah . ”

28 Peter faithfully carried out his assignment for many years . He strengthened his brothers , as Jesus had commanded on the eve of His death . Peter worked kindly and patiently at shepherding and feeding Christ ’ s followers . The man called Simon came to live up to the name that Jesus had given him—Peter , or Rock—by becoming a steady , strong , reliable force for good in the congregation . Much evidence to that effect is found in the two warm , personal letters Peter wrote that became valuable books of the Bible . Those letters show , too , that Peter never forgot the lesson he had learned from Jesus about forgiveness .—Read 1 Peter 3 :8 , 9 ; 4 :8 .

11 Jehovah molds his servants today primarily by means of his Word , his holy spirit , and the Christian congregation . God ’ s Word can mold us as we read it purposefully , meditate on it , and ask Jehovah to help us apply it . “ I remember you while upon my bed , ” wrote David . “ I meditate on you during the watches of the night . ” ( Ps . 63 :6 ) He also wrote : “ I will praise Jehovah , who has given me advice . Even during the night , my innermost thoughts correct me . ” ( Ps . 16 :7 ) Yes , David allowed divine counsel to settle into the deepest parts of his being , to mold his innermost thoughts and feelings , even when the counsel was strong . ( 2 Sam . 12 :1-13 ) What a fine example of humility and submissiveness David set for us ! Do you too meditate on God ’ s Word , allowing it to settle into your innermost parts ? Should you do so even more ? —Ps . 1 :2 , 3 .

Then David offered up burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before Jehovah . 18 When David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices , he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of armies . 19 Further , he distributed to all the people , to the whole multitude of Israel , to each man and woman , a ring-shaped loaf of bread , a date cake , and a raisin cake , and then all the people left , each to his own house .

JEHOVAH is the Source of wisdom , and he generously shares his wisdom with others . Says James 1 :5 : “ If any one of you is lacking in wisdom , let him keep asking God , for he gives generously to all and without reproaching . ” One way that we acquire wisdom from God is by accepting his discipline . And that wisdom can safeguard us from moral and spiritual harm . ( Prov . 2 :10-12 ) As a result , we “ keep [ ourselves ] in God ’ s love . . . with everlasting life in view . ” —Jude 21 .

According to Strabo's Geographica , before the expansion of the Roman Republic , the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulf of Salerno and gulf of Taranto , corresponding roughly to the current region of Calabria . Later the term was extended by Romans to include the Italian Peninsula up to the Rubicon , a river located between Northern and Central Italy . In 49 BC , with the Lex Roscia , Julius Caesar gave Roman citizenship to the people of the Cisalpine Gaul ,[34] while in 42 BCE the hitherto existing province was abolished , thus extending Italy to the north up to the southern foot of the Alps .

12 In the 11th century B .C .E . , Jehovah shed further light on the sacred secret when he made another covenant . He promised faithful King David : “ I shall certainly raise up your seed after you , . . . and I shall indeed firmly establish his kingdom . . . . I shall certainly establish the throne of his kingdom firmly to time indefinite . ” ( 2 Samuel 7 :12 , 13 ; Psalm 89 :3 ) Now the lineage of the promised Seed had been narrowed down to the house of David . But could an ordinary human rule “ to time indefinite ” ? ( Psalm 89 :20 , 29 , 34-36 ) And could such a human king rescue mankind from sin and death ?

And if your income is low and you have a self - contained rented flat , you will often qualify for rent allowance . See the page Work & income for more information about this subject . For electricity and gas , you will have to enter into a contract with a power supplier . For water and also for district heating instead of gas you cannot choose your supplier and you will have to register with the company that supplies water at your address . For television , telephone , and internet connection , there are many providers to choose from . Ask your counsellor at the Dutch Council for Refugees to help you make a choice .

31 Then Hez·e·kiʹah said : “ Now that you have been set apart for Jehovah , come and bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings to the house of Jehovah . ” So the congregation began to bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings , and everyone with a willing heart brought burnt offerings . 32 The number of burnt offerings that the congregation brought was 70 cattle , 100 rams , 200 male lambs—all of these as a burnt offering to Jehovah— 33 and the holy offerings were 600 cattle and 3 ,000 of the flock . 34 But there were not enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings , so their brothers the Levites helped them out until the work was finished and until the priests could sanctify themselves , for the Levites were more conscientious about sanctifying themselves than the priests were . 35 Also , there were many burnt offerings , as well as the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings . Thus the service of the house of Jehovah was restored . 36 So Hez·e·kiʹah and all the people rejoiced over what the true God had established for the people , for this had all happened so suddenly .

If we have accomplished something worthwhile , could it be that Jehovah is ‘ leaving us alone to put us to the test , ’ allowing what is in our heart to surface ? For example , a brother may have worked hard to prepare a talk and give it before a large audience . Many praise him for what he has done . How will he react to the praise ? When praised , we do well to apply Jesus ’ words : “ When you have done all the things assigned to you , say : ‘ We are good-for-nothing slaves . What we have done is what we ought to have done . ’ ” ( Luke 17 :10 ) We can learn from Hezekiah ’ s experience . A haughty attitude surfaced in that he “ did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him . ” ( 2 Chron . 32 :24-27 , 31 ) Our meditating on how much God has done for us will help us to avoid an attitude that Jehovah hates . We can speak appreciatively of Jehovah who loyally supports his people . w17 .03 4 :12-14

Go in peace , and be healed from your grievous sickness . ” —Mark 5 :34 .

9 Paul stressed that we must strongly reject the view : ‘ Oh , God understands . He will overlook my wrong deeds or actions . ’ Why ? Because , as Paul writes , Christians have “ died with reference to sin . ” ( Read Romans 6 :1 , 2 . ) While they were still alive on earth , how could it be said of them that they had “ died with reference to sin ” ?
16 Every human life is important to Jehovah . Even an unborn baby is precious to him . Under the Law of Moses , if a person accidentally hurt a pregnant woman and either she or her baby died , Jehovah held that person guilty of manslaughter . This meant that even though it was an accident , someone had been killed and the life had to be compensated for . ( Read Exodus 21 :22 , 23 . ) To God , an unborn baby is a living person . Knowing that , how do you think he feels about abortion ? How do you think he feels when he sees millions of unborn babies killed every year ?

AROUND the globe there is a thrilling movement toward unity of worship . It is bringing together millions of people of all nations , tribes , and languages . More are being gathered each year . These are identified in the Bible as “ witnesses ” of Jehovah and are called “ a great crowd . ” They render God “ sacred service day and night . ” ( Isaiah 43 :10-12 ; Revelation 7 :9-15 ) Why do they do this ? Because they have come to know Jehovah as the only true God . This motivates them to bring their lives into harmony with his righteous ways . Also , they have learned that we are living in “ the last days ” of this present wicked world , that God will soon destroy it , and that he will replace it with his paradisaic new world .—2 Timothy 3 :1-5 , 13 ; 2 Peter 3 :10-13 .

He wanted to kill them in the mountains and exterminate them from the surface of the earth ’ ? Turn from your burning anger and reconsider your decision to bring this calamity on your people . 13 Remember your servants Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , to whom you swore by yourself and said : ‘ I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens , and I will give all this land that I have designated to your offspring , so that they may take it as a permanent possession . ’ ”

40 Hiʹram also made the basins , the shovels , and the bowls . So Hiʹram finished all the work that he did for King Solʹo·mon on the house of Jehovah : 41 the two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars ; the two networks to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars ; 42 the 400 pomegranates for the two networks , two rows of pomegranates for each network , to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the two pillars ; 43 the ten carriages and the ten basins on the carriages ; 44 the Sea and the 12 bulls beneath the Sea ; 45 and the cans , the shovels , the bowls , and all the utensils , which Hiʹram made of polished copper for King Solʹo·mon for the house of Jehovah . 46 The king cast them in clay molds in the district of the Jordan , between Sucʹcoth and Zarʹe·than .

6 Do you know why people make the mistake of blaming God for all the suffering in the world ? In many cases , they blame Almighty God because they think that he is the real ruler of this world .

Check the Cross-References . Some Bibles have cross-references . Does yours ? If so , these may help . Note an example from the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures . First Peter 3 :6 points to Sarah as an example worthy of imitation by Christian wives . A cross-reference to Genesis 18 :12 reinforces that by disclosing that Sarah spoke of Abraham as lord “ inside herself . ” Her submission , therefore , was heartfelt . In addition to such insights , cross-references may refer you to texts that show the fulfillment of a Bible prophecy or of a Law covenant pattern . Realize , however , that some cross-references are not meant to give such explanations . They may simply refer to parallel thoughts or to biographical or geographic information .

5 We have put away sinful practices that would disqualify us as members of the Christian congregation . ( 1 Cor . 6 :9 , 10 ) Nevertheless , we are still imperfect . ( Col . 3 :9 , 10 ) It is therefore unrealistic to expect that after baptism—or even after many years in the truth—we will no longer make mistakes , experience setbacks , or be troubled with wrong motives and inclinations . Certain tendencies might persist for years .
Jehovah will never abandon you . When you follow his guidance , you will have peace .
An experienced traveler wants to know where each road leads . He may consult a map and talk to people who know the area . He will certainly take note of signposts he encounters along the way .

Then they would ponder over this . They would consider their end afterward . ” —Deuteronomy 32 :29 .

16 Therefore , do not let anyone judge you about what you eat and drink or about the observance of a festival or of the new moon or of a sabbath . 17 Those things are a shadow of the things to come , but the reality belongs to the Christ . 18 Let no man deprive you of the prize who takes delight in a false humility and a form of worship of the angels , “ taking his stand on ” the things he has seen . He is actually puffed up without proper cause by his fleshly frame of mind , 19 and he is not holding fast to the head , to the one through whom the whole body is supplied and harmoniously joined together by means of its joints and ligaments and made to grow with the growth that is from God .

11 When Ruth first mentioned Boaz , Naomi said : “ The man is related to us . He is one of our repurchasers . ” ( Ruth 2 :20 ) What did that mean ? God ’ s Law to Israel included loving provisions for families who as a result of poverty or bereavement fell on hard times . If a woman was widowed while still childless , she was especially devastated because her husband ’ s name , his posterity , would be cut off , lost to future generations . However , God ’ s Law allowed the man ’ s brother to marry the widow so that she could give birth to an heir who might carry on her deceased husband ’ s name and care for the family property .—Deut . 25 :5-7 .

But as for us , we can not stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard . ” Rather than praying to God for persecution to stop , they and fellow believers made supplication , saying : “ Jehovah , give attention to their threats , and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness . ” ( Acts 4 :5 , 19 , 20 , 29 ) How did Jehovah respond to their request ? ( Read Acts 4 :31 . ) Jehovah helped them muster up boldness by means of his spirit . God ’ s spirit can do the same for us . How , then , can we receive God ’ s spirit and be directed by it in our ministry ?

3 Psalm 70 begins and ends with an urgent cry for God ’ s help . ( Read Psalm 70 :1-5 . ) David implores Jehovah to “ make haste ” and to “ act quickly ” to deliver him . In the verses in-between , David makes five petitions , each beginning with “ may ” and expressing a desire , or wish . The first three are about those trying to kill him . David petitions Jehovah to defeat these enemies and shame them for their wickedness . The next two pleas , in verse 4 , relate to God ’ s people . David prays that those seeking Jehovah be moved to rejoice and to magnify him . In concluding his psalm , David says to Jehovah : “ You are my help and the Provider of escape for me . ” Notice that David does not say , “ May you prove to be , ” as if making another petition . Instead , he says , “ You are , ” expressing his confidence . David believes that he will receive divine help .

Jehovah said : ‘ These have no master . Let each one go back to his house in peace . ’ ”

And he saw the linen cloths lying there . 7 The cloth that had been on his head was not lying with the other cloth bands but was rolled up in a place by itself . 8 Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in , and he saw and believed . 9 For they did not yet understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead . 10 So the disciples went back to their homes .

During the Early Middle Ages , Italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions , but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics , mainly in the northern and central regions of Italy , rose to great prosperity through shipping , commerce and banking , laying the groundwork for modern capitalism . These mostly independent statelets , acting as Europe's main spice trade hubs with Asia and the Near East , often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy than the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout Europe ; however , part of central Italy was under the control of the theocratic Papal States , while Southern Italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century , partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine , Arab , Norman , Angevin and Spanish conquests of the region .
The universe truly is a marvel of organization . Surely , then , we should expect that Jehovah wants his worshippers to be well-organized . In fact , to that end God has provided the Bible for our guidance . Living without the help of God ’ s organization and his standards would result in unhappiness and misery . The people of ancient Israel were a model of organization . Under the Mosaic Law , for example , there were “ women who were organized to serve at the entrance of the tent of meeting . ” ( Ex . 38 :8 ) Later , King David organized the Levites and the priests into effective divisions . ( 1 Chron . 23 :1-6 ; 24 :1-3 ) The first-century Christian congregation was organized , and it benefited from the direction of the governing body , initially made up of the apostles . ( Acts 6 :1-6 ) Counsel and instructions were also provided by means of inspired letters .—1 Tim . 3 :1-13 ; Titus 1 :5-9 . w16 .11 2 :3 , 6 , 8 , 9

2 In the decades leading up to World War I , Charles Taze Russell and his associates realized that the organizations of Christendom were not teaching Bible truth . Accordingly , they resolved to have nothing to do with false religion as they understood it . As early as November of 1879 , Zion ’ s Watch Tower straightforwardly set out their Scriptural position by stating : “ Every church claiming to be a chaste virgin espoused to Christ , but in reality united to and supported by the world ( beast ) we must condemn as being in scripture language a harlot church , ” a reference to Babylon the Great .—Read Revelation 17 :1 , 2 .

Several of the apostles are well-qualified to sail the boat , but this is not going to be an easy trip . There are surrounding mountains , and the surface of the Sea of Galilee is often quite warm .

Soon the waves are dashing against the boat . It begins “ to fill up with water and to be in danger . ” ( Luke 8 :23 ) Still , Jesus remains asleep !

11 But Jehovah said to the Israelites : “ Did I not save you from Egypt and from the Amʹor·ites , the Amʹmon·ites , the Phi·lisʹtines , 12 the Si·doʹni·ans , Amʹa·lek , and Midʹi·an when they oppressed you ? When you cried out to me , I saved you out of their hand . 13 But you abandoned me and served other gods . That is why I will not save you again . 14 Go to the gods whom you have chosen and call for help . Let them save you in your time of distress . ” 15 But the Israelites said to Jehovah : “ We have sinned . Do to us whatever is good in your eyes . Only save us , please , this day . ” 16 And they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Jehovah , so that he could no longer tolerate Israel ’ s suffering .
13 Matthew ’ s Gospel quotes Jesus as saying : “ Stop judging that you may not be judged . ” ( Matt . 7 :1 ) According to Luke , Jesus said : “ Stop judging , and you will by no means be judged ; and stop condemning , and you will by no means be condemned . Keep on releasing , and you will be released . ” ( Luke 6 :37 ) The first-century Pharisees judged others harshly , in keeping with unscriptural traditions . Any of Jesus ’ listeners who did that were to “ stop judging . ” Instead , they were to “ keep on releasing , ” that is , forgiving the shortcomings of others . The apostle Paul gave similar counsel regarding forgiveness , as noted above .

The king said to the girl : “ Ask me for whatever you want , and I will give it to you . ” 23 Yes , he swore to her : “ Whatever you ask me for , I will give it to you , up to half my kingdom . ” 24 So she went out and said to her mother : “ What should I ask for ? ” She said : “ The head of John the Baptizer . ” 25 She immediately rushed in to the king and made her request , saying : “ I want you to give me right away on a platter the head of John the Baptist . ” 26 Although this deeply grieved him , the king did not want to disregard her request , because of his oaths and his guests . 27 So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring John ’ s head . So he went off and beheaded him in the prison 28 and brought his head on a platter . He gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother . 29 When his disciples heard of it , they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb .

10 Those laws served to teach a vital truth . How , after all , is the stain of Adam ’ s sin transmitted from one generation to the next ? Is it not through sexual relations and childbirth ? ( Romans 5 :12 ) Yes , God ’ s Law reminded his people of the ever-present reality of sin . All of us , in fact , are born in sin . ( Psalm 51 :5 ) We need forgiveness and redemption in order to draw close to our holy God .

16 Most of Jehovah ’ s people have not had to endure severe persecution . Their tests of faith have been different . Many have had to endure poverty or have suffered during civil wars or natural disasters . Others are like Moses and the patriarchs in that they have given up a life of worldly ease or fame . They fight hard to resist being tempted to live a materialistic , self-centered lifestyle . What is it that enables them to do this ? Their love for Jehovah and their strong faith in the promise that he will correct all injustices and reward his faithful servants with everlasting life in a new world of righteousness .—Read Psalm 37 :5 , 7 , 9 , 29 .

IN CONNECTION with the annual commemoration of Jesus ’ death , have you read Romans 8 :15-17 ? Probably so . That key passage explains how Christians know that they are anointed—holy spirit bears witness with their spirit . And the opening verse in that chapter refers to “ those in union with Christ Jesus . ” But does Romans chapter 8 apply only to anointed ones ? Or does it also speak to Christians who hope to live on earth ?
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .

The apostle John warned that if anyone loves the things in the world— “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one ’ s means of life ” —then “ the love of the Father is not in him . ” ( 1 John 2 :15 , 16 ) This means that we need to examine our heart constantly to see if it is being enticed by worldly entertainment , associations , and styles of dress and grooming . Or the love of the world might involve efforts to attain “ great things , ” such as through the pursuit of higher education . We stand at the threshold of the promised new world . Thus , how important it is that we keep well in mind Moses ’ powerful words at Deuteronomy 6 :4 ! If we clearly understand and firmly believe that “ Jehovah our God is one Jehovah , ” we will do all we can to give him exclusive devotion , serving him as he approves .—Heb . 12 :28 , 29 . w16 .06 3 :14
Jehovah expects us to put to good use the abilities with which he has endowed us . Why ? Because he loves us , and he knows that it brings us satisfaction when we employ these gifts . At the same time , Jehovah knows that humans have limitations . On our own , we can never eliminate imperfection , sin , and death ; neither can we control other people , for all have free will . ( 1 Ki . 8 :46 ) And no matter how much knowledge or experience we gain , we will always be like children in comparison with Jehovah . ( Isa . 55 :9 ) In all circumstances , we need to lean on Jehovah for guidance , trusting in him to support us and do for us what we can not do for ourselves . At the same time , we should do what we can , taking appropriate action to solve problems and help others . In short , we need both ‘ to trust in Jehovah and to do what is good ’ ; we need ‘ to act with faithfulness . ’ w17 .01 1 :2-4

Reading goes hand in hand with recognition . Even as you are reading right now , you are recognizing words and remembering their meaning . You can increase the pace of your reading if you broaden out the area of recognition . Instead of stopping to look at each word , try to see several words at a time . As you develop this ability , you will find that you more clearly understand what you are reading .

1 . Communication : Providing information accurately and promptly is critical to effective work and team performance . This is particularly important when a project is troubled and needs immediate corrective actions . However , people from different cultures vary in how they relate to bad news . People from some Asian cultures are reluctant to give supervisors bad news – while those from other cultures may exaggerate it .
17 And fear came on him , and he said , This is a holy place ; this is nothing less than the house of God and the doorway of heaven .
24 Be courageous , and may your heart be strong ,
Commit your way to Jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your behalf .—Ps . 37 :5 .
17 We do well to ask ourselves , ‘ Do we value the way Christ has been refining his followers , training us to adhere to Jehovah ’ s lofty moral standards ? ’ If so , then let us keep in mind that Satan is ever seeking to alienate us from Jehovah and Jesus by eroding our respect for godly morals . To counter that influence , Jehovah ’ s organization consistently provides loving warnings and reminders about the immoral ways of this world . Let us remain alert , responsive , and obedient to such helpful counsel .—Prov . 19 :20 .
And fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness . ”
5 Let them praise the name of Jehovah ,
15 Clearly , this kind of love is the identifying mark of true Christians . Jesus said : “ By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love among yourselves . ” ( John 13 :35 ) Our love for one another draws people to the God whom we love and represent . For example , from Mozambique comes this report about a Witness family . “ We had never seen anything like it . In the afternoon , a fierce wind began to blow , followed by heavy rain and hailstones . The strong winds destroyed our reed house , and the zinc roofing sheets blew away . When our brothers from neighboring congregations came and helped to rebuild our house , our astonished neighbors said : ‘ Your religion is very good . We have never received help like this from our church . ’ We opened the Bible and showed them John 13 :34 , 35 . Many of our neighbors are now studying the Bible . ”

11 What should members of Branch Committees or Country Committees , circuit overseers , and congregation elders do when they receive direction from God ’ s organization today ? Jehovah ’ s own Book directs all of us to be obedient and submissive . ( Deut . 30 :16 ; Heb . 13 :7 , 17 ) A critical or rebellious spirit has no place in God ’ s organization , for such an attitude could disrupt our loving , peaceful , and united congregations . Of course , no loyal Christian would want to display a disrespectful and disloyal spirit like that of Diotrephes . ( Read 3 John 9 , 10 . ) We might well ask ourselves : ‘ Do I contribute to the spirituality of those around me ? Am I quick to accept and support the direction given by the brothers taking the lead ? ’

Death is the opposite of life . Death is like a deep sleep . ( John 11 :11-14 ) The dead are unable to hear , see , speak , or think anything . ( Ecclesiastes 9 :5 , 10 ) False religion teaches that the dead go to a spirit world to live with their ancestors . That is not what the Bible teaches .

15 , 16 . How do you view the preaching work ?
Declaring the good news of the Kingdom was Jesus ’ primary assignment . However , he took time to train others to be shepherds and teachers . ( Matt . 10 :5-7 ) Although Philip was busy as an evangelizer , he no doubt helped his four daughters to become effective in sharing Scriptural truths with others . ( Acts 21 :8 , 9 ) How important is such training today ? Worldwide , the number of people accepting the good news is growing . New ones who are not yet baptized need to grasp the importance of personal Bible study . They must also be taught to preach the good news to others and to teach them the truth . In our congregations , brothers need to be encouraged to work hard in order to qualify for appointment as ministerial servants and elders . By means of “ good instruction , ” mature Christians can help new ones to make spiritual progress . w16 .08 4 :1 , 2

ENCAMPED on the Plains of Moab in 1473 B .C .E . , the Israelites must be thrilled to hear these words : “ Get provisions ready for yourselves , because three days from now you are crossing this Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to take possession of it . ” ( Joshua 1 :11 ) Their 40-year wilderness sojourn is about to end .
11 To acquaint ourselves with Jehovah ’ s thinking , we need to make personal study a priority . When reading or studying God ’ s Word , we might ask ourselves , ‘ What does this material reveal about Jehovah , his righteous ways , and his thinking ? ’ We need to have an attitude like that of the psalmist David , who sang : “ Make me know your ways , O Jehovah ; teach me your paths . Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me , for you are my God of salvation . In you I hope all day long . ” ( Ps . 25 :4 , 5 ) As you meditate on a Bible passage , you might consider questions like these : ‘ How can I apply this information in my family ? Where can I apply it ? At home ? At work ? At school ? In the ministry ? ’ Once we have determined where the material can be applied , it may become easier to perceive how we can put it to work .

The foremost key to such conversation is caring deeply about one another . ( Deut . 6 :6 , 7 ; Prov . 4 :1-4 ) When we care , we communicate , and we listen when the other person wants to say something . Another important factor is having something worthwhile to say . If we have a regular program of personal Bible reading and study , there will be much that we can share . Wise use of the booklet Examining the Scriptures Daily can stimulate discussion . During the day , perhaps we have an enjoyable experience in the field service . We may read something that is informative or humorous . We should make it a practice to share these things during wholesome family conversation . This will also help us to converse with people outside the family circle .
I will also reject you from serving as my priest ;

You teach not only by what you say but also by what you do . Your actions provide a practical example of how to apply the things you say . This is the way that children learn . When they imitate their parents , they give evidence that they want to be like their parents . They want to know what it is like to do what their parents are doing . Likewise , when those whom you teach ‘ become imitators of you as you are of Christ , ’ they begin to experience the blessings of walking in Jehovah ’ s ways . ( 1 Cor . 11 :1 ) God ’ s dealings with them become part of their own experiences .
