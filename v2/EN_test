6 Of course , Jehovah does not expect you to know everything in the Bible before you get baptized . He didn ’ t expect the Ethiopian man to know everything before he got baptized . ( Acts 8 :30 , 31 ) And we will continue learning about God forever .

5 Jehovah later said to Moses : “ Say to Aaron , ‘ Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers , the Nile canals , and the marshes , and make the frogs come up over the land of Egypt . ’ ” 6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt , and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of Egypt . 7 However , the magic-practicing priests did the same thing by their secret arts , and they too made the frogs come up over the land of Egypt . 8 Pharʹaoh then called Moses and Aaron and said : “ Plead with Jehovah to remove the frogs from me and my people , as I want to send the people away so that they may sacrifice to Jehovah . ” 9 Then Moses said to Pharʹaoh : “ I leave to you the honor of telling me when I should plead to have the frogs removed from you , your servants , your people , and your houses . Only in the Nile River will they be left . ” 10 To this he said : “ Tomorrow . ” So he said : “ It will be according to your word so that you may know that there is no one else like Jehovah our God . 11 The frogs will depart from you , your houses , your servants , and your people . They will be left only in the Nile . ”

7 When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism , he said to them : “ You offspring of vipers , who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath ? 8 Therefore , produce fruit that befits repentance . 9 Do not presume to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones . 10 The ax is already lying at the root of the trees . Every tree , then , that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire . 11 I , for my part , baptize you with water because of your repentance , but the one coming after me is stronger than I am , whose sandals I am not worthy to take off . That one will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire . 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand , and he will clean up his threshing floor completely and will gather his wheat into the storehouse , but the chaff he will burn up with fire that can not be put out . ”

21 Today , with all the problems that tend to dishearten , many need encouragement . Elders , what can you do to help “ depressed souls ” ? ( 1 Thessalonians 5 :14 ) Listen to them with empathy . ( James 1 :19 ) They may need to share the “ anxious care ” in their heart with someone they trust . ( Proverbs 12 :25 ) Reassure them that they are wanted , valued , and loved—yes , by Jehovah and also by their brothers and sisters . ( 1 Peter 1 :22 ; 5 :6 , 7 ) In addition , you can pray with and for such ones . Hearing an elder say a heartfelt prayer in their behalf can be most comforting . ( James 5 :14 , 15 ) Your loving efforts to help depressed ones will not go unnoticed by the God of justice .

Even if you make only a little improvement , you will likely feel less stress , or at least you will be handling stress better , and you will have a method for continuing . Do not forget that there are many other fine points of Jesus ’ teachings that are not on the list . Why not search for some of them and try putting them into practice ? —Philippians 3 :16 .

31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle ,
Rabbinic rules stated that no one should come within four cubits ( about six feet ) ( 1 .8 m ) of a leper . But if a wind was blowing , the leper had to be kept at least 100 cubits ( about 150 feet ) ( 45 m ) away . The Midrash Rabbah tells of one rabbi who hid from lepers and of another who threw stones at lepers to keep them away . Lepers thus knew the pain of rejection and the feeling of being despised and unwanted .

16 “ At that time I instructed your judges , ‘ When you hear a case between your brothers , you are to judge with righteousness between a man and his brother or a foreign resident . 17 You must not be partial in judgment . You should hear the small one the same as the great one . You must not become intimidated by men , for the judgment belongs to God ; and if a case is too difficult for you , you should present it to me , and I will hear it . ’ 18 At that time I instructed you regarding all the things that you should do .
In many parts of the world , schools also help children learn things about life .
Jesus tells the man : “ You answered correctly ; keep doing this and you will get life . ” But does that end the discussion ? The man does not want just a factual answer ; he is seeking “ to prove himself righteous , ” to have confirmation that his views are correct and that he is thus justified in how he treats others . So he asks : “ Who really is my neighbor ? ” ( Luke 10 :28 , 29 ) That seemingly simple question has deep implications . How so ?

5 By using the same Greek word for both activities , Paul grouped relief work with other forms of ministry that were carried out in the Christian congregation . He had stated earlier : “ There are different ministries , and yet there is the same Lord ; and there are different activities , . . . But [ they ] are performed by the very same spirit . ” ( 1 Cor . 12 :4-6 , 11 ) In fact , Paul linked the various congregational ministries with “ sacred service . ” ( Rom . 12 :1 , 6-8 ) No wonder he felt that it was appropriate to give part of his time “ to minister to the holy ones ” ! —Rom . 15 :25 , 26 .

12 When disasters strike , God ’ s people have opportunities to work with God by helping their brothers in practical ways . For example , they give financial support to those affected . ( John 13 :34 , 35 ; Acts 11 :27-30 ) Another practical way is by assisting with cleaning or reconstruction . Gabriela , a sister from Poland whose home was virtually destroyed by a flood , cheered up when brothers from nearby congregations came to her aid . “ I don ’ t want to talk about what I lost—those are just material things , ” she relates . “ Rather , I want to tell you how much I gained . This experience reassured me that being a part of the Christian congregation is a unique privilege as well as a source of joy and happiness . ” Many who receive help after a disaster say that they feel richer from the experience . And those who work with Jehovah to provide such help enjoy great satisfaction themselves .—Read Acts 20 :35 ; 2 Corinthians 9 :6 , 7 .

16 And the word of Jehovah again came to me , saying : 17 “ Son of man , when the house of Israel was dwelling in their land , they made it unclean by their ways and their dealings . Their ways were like the uncleanness of menstruation to me . 18 So I poured out my rage on them because of the blood that they had shed upon the land and because they made the land unclean with their disgusting idols . 19 So I scattered them among the nations and dispersed them among the lands . I judged them according to their way and according to their dealings . 20 But when they came to those nations , people profaned my holy name by saying about them , ‘ These are the people of Jehovah , but they had to leave his land . ’ 21 So I will show concern for my holy name , which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they have gone . ”

12 “ ‘ Observe the Sabbath day to keep it sacred , just as Jehovah your God commanded you . 13 You are to labor and do all your work in six days , 14 but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God . You must not do any work , neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your bull nor your donkey nor any of your domestic animals nor your foreign resident who is inside your cities , in order that your slave man and your slave girl may rest the same as you . 15 Remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm . That is why Jehovah your God commanded you to observe the Sabbath day .
11 Jehovah has assigned elders the responsibility of helping the congregation . It is easier for the elders to help us when we are honest with them . Why ? If you were sick and you went to a doctor for help , would you hide some of your symptoms from him ? If you did that , how could he help you ? In a similar way , if we made a serious mistake , we should not lie about it . Instead , we should go to the elders and talk honestly about it . ( Psalm 12 :2 ; Acts 5 :1-11 ) Now imagine a different situation : What if you found out that your friend had made a serious mistake ? ( Leviticus 5 :1 ) Would you say : “ If I ’ m really his friend , I will keep it a secret ” ? Or would you remember that the elders are there to give him the help he needs so that he can repair and strengthen his relationship with Jehovah ? —Hebrews 13 :17 ; James 5 :14 , 15 .

17 But Sisʹe·ra fled on foot to the tent of Jaʹel the wife of Heʹber the Kenʹite , for there was peace between Jaʹbin the king of Haʹzor and the house of Heʹber the Kenʹite . 18 Then Jaʹel came out to meet Sisʹe·ra and said to him : “ Come in , my lord , come in here . Do not be afraid . ” So he went into her tent , and she covered him with a blanket . 19 Then he said to her : “ Give me , please , a little water to drink , for I am thirsty . ” So she opened a skin bottle of milk and gave him a drink , after which she again covered him . 20 He told her : “ Stand at the entrance of the tent , and if anybody comes and asks you , ‘ Is there a man here ? ’ say , ‘ No ! ’ ”

26 When the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard of it , he immediately said : “ It is the man of the true God who rebelled against the order of Jehovah ; so Jehovah gave him over to the lion , to maul and to kill him , according to the word of Jehovah that he spoke to him . ” 27 He then said to his sons : “ Saddle the donkey for me . ” So they saddled it . 28 Then he went on his way and found the dead body thrown onto the road , with the donkey and the lion standing beside it . The lion had not eaten the dead body , nor had it mauled the donkey . 29 The prophet lifted up the dead body of the man of the true God and put him on the donkey , and he brought him back into his own city to mourn and bury him . 30 So he laid the dead body in his own tomb , and they kept crying out over him : “ Too bad , my brother ! ” 31 After burying him , he told his sons : “ When I die , you must bury me in the place where the man of the true God is buried . Lay my bones next to his bones . 32 The word that he called out by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethʹel and against all the houses of worship on the high places in the cities of Sa·marʹi·a is sure to take place . ”

12 “ All sorts of trees for food will grow on both banks of the stream . Their leaves will not wither ; nor will their fruitage fail . Each month they will bear new fruit , because the water for them flows from the sanctuary . Their fruitage will serve as food and their leaves for healing . ”
The importance of the proper motive in reading becomes clear upon examination of the Gospel accounts . In Matthew ’ s Gospel , for example , we find Jesus asking well-versed religious leaders such questions as “ Have you not read ? ” and “ Did you never read this ? ” prior to his giving them the Scriptural answers to their crafty questions . ( Matt . 12 :3 , 5 ; 19 :4 ; 21 :16 , 42 ; 22 :31 ) One lesson we learn from this is that if our motive for reading is improper , we can draw incorrect conclusions or miss the point altogether . The Pharisees were reading the Scriptures because they thought that by means of them , they would get everlasting life . That reward , as Jesus pointed out , is not granted to those who do not love God and accept His means of salvation . ( John 5 :39-43 ) The intentions of the Pharisees were selfish ; hence , many of their conclusions were wrong .
5 Then Samuel said : “ Gather all Israel together at Mizʹpah , and I will pray to Jehovah in your behalf . ” 6 So they gathered together at Mizʹpah , and they drew water and poured it out before Jehovah and kept a fast on that day . There they said : “ We have sinned against Jehovah . ” And Samuel began serving as judge over the Israelites in Mizʹpah .

7 What are the objectives of our relief ministry ? Paul addressed that question in his second letter to the Corinthians . ( Read 2 Corinthians 9 :11-15 . ) In these verses , Paul highlights three main objectives , or goals , that we attain by sharing in “ the ministry of this public service , ” that is , relief work . Let us consider them one at a time .
Our appreciation for God ’ s undeserved kindness involves more than avoiding adultery , drunkenness , or other sins that some in Corinth had been guilty of . ( 1 Cor . 6 :9-11 ) Accepting God ’ s undeserved kindness means not only avoiding sexual immorality but also fighting any tendency to enjoy lewd entertainment . Presenting our members as slaves to righteousness will not only keep us from drunkenness but also move us to shun drinking to the point of almost being drunk . It may require considerable effort for us to fight against such wrong practices ; still , it is a fight that we can win . Our goal should be to avoid gross sins as well as wrongs that are not as flagrant . We will not be able to do that perfectly . Nevertheless , we should strive to do so , even as Paul did . He urged his brothers : “ Do not let sin continue to rule as king in your mortal bodies so that you should obey their desires . ” —Rom . 6 :12 ; 7 :18-20 . w16 .12 1 :16 , 19-21

Indeed , our clean appearance and fine conduct will bring glory to , not reproach on , Jehovah and his holy name .—Ezekiel 36 :22 ; read 1 Peter 2 :12 .

Do you know how many silver coins I have collected ? ” The little boy in that story displayed a quality that adults could benefit from—practical wisdom .

To a great extent , this depends on history . Over the years , how has the government of the land where you live dealt with Jehovah ’ s Witnesses ? Is there a measure of religious freedom ? If so , that likely has a lot to do with the way your spiritual brothers and sisters over the decades have worked hard in “ the defending and legally establishing of the good news . ” ( Phil . 1 :7 ) Wherever you live , pondering the record of the legal victories of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses can be very faith-strengthening . In this section , we will examine some of that remarkable record . Our victories provide thrilling proof that the Kingdom is a reality , for we could never have achieved so much on our own !

19 By this we will know that we originate with the truth , and we will assure our hearts before him 20 regarding whatever our hearts may condemn us in , because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things . 21 Beloved ones , if our hearts do not condemn us , we have freeness of speech toward God ; 22 and whatever we ask we receive from him , because we are observing his commandments and doing what is pleasing in his eyes . 23 Indeed , this is his commandment : that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another , just as he gave us a commandment . 24 Moreover , the one who observes his commandments remains in union with him , and he in union with such one . And by the spirit that he gave us , we know that he remains in union with us .
In Bible times , the Hebrew word for “ rod ” meant a stick or a staff , such as the one a shepherd used to guide his sheep . ( Psalm 23 :4 ) Similarly , “ the rod ” of parental authority suggests loving guidance , not harsh or brutal punishment .

The first of these two articles discusses how we can throw all our anxiety on God . The second article explains how we can strengthen our faith by being firmly convinced that God rewards those who earnestly seek him . It also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
1 In the 30th year , on the fifth day of the fourth month , while I was among the exiled people by the river Cheʹbar , the heavens were opened and I began to see visions of God . 2 On the fifth day of the month—that is , in the fifth year of the exile of King Je·hoiʹa·chin— 3 the word of Jehovah came to Ezekiel son of Buʹzi the priest by the river Cheʹbar in the land of the Chal·deʹans . There the hand of Jehovah came upon him .
You too need to keep honing your skills . Do not let your spirituality stagnate or your understanding of congregation procedures go out-of-date .

10 The apostle Paul . In his letters , Paul spoke highly of his fellow Christians . He had traveled with some of them for years and undoubtedly knew their faults , but he said good things about them . For instance , Paul described Timothy as his “ beloved and faithful child in the Lord , ” one who would genuinely care for the concerns of other Christians . ( 1 Cor . 4 :17 ; Phil . 2 :19 , 20 ) The apostle commended Titus to the Corinthian congregation as “ my companion and a fellow worker for your interests . ” ( 2 Cor . 8 :23 ) How encouraged Timothy and Titus must have been to learn what Paul thought of them !

21 But true Christians are “ no part of the world . ” Jehovah ’ s people are neutral in politics and in war . Just as they do not kill , they do not support any organization that kills people . ( John 15 :19 ; 17 :16 ) When Christians are persecuted , they do not respond with violence . Jesus taught that we should love even our enemies .—Matthew 5 :44 ; Romans 12 :17-21 .

10 What will happen at that meeting ? The elders will talk with you to see if you understand and believe basic Bible teachings , if you obey what the Bible says in your daily life , and if you really want to become one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . Remember that the elders take care of all the members of the congregation , including you , so don ’ t be afraid to talk to them . ( Acts 20 :28 ; 1 Peter 5 :2 , 3 ) After this meeting , the elders will let you know if you can begin preaching with the congregation .

14 Imagine seeing the whole earth turned into Paradise ! Jehovah says of that time : “ Look ! I am making all things new . ” ( Revelation 21 :5 ) Consider what that will mean . When Jehovah has finished wielding his destructive power against this wicked old system , there will remain “ new heavens and a new earth . ” This means that a new government will reign from heaven over a new earthly society composed of those who love Jehovah and who do his will . ( 2 Peter 3 :13 ) Satan , along with his demons , will be put out of commission . ( Revelation 20 :3 ) For the first time in thousands of years , mankind will be free of that corrupt , hateful , negative influence . The sense of relief will no doubt be overwhelming .

13 People now began bringing him young children for him to touch them , but the disciples reprimanded them . 14 At seeing this , Jesus was indignant and said to them : “ Let the young children come to me ; do not try to stop them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones . 15 Truly I say to you , whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it . ” 16 And he took the children into his arms and began blessing them , laying his hands on them .
18 And I spoke to the people in the morning , and my wife died in the evening . So I did in the morning just as I had been commanded . 19 The people were saying to me : “ Will you not tell us what these things you are doing have to do with us ? ” 20 I replied to them : “ The word of Jehovah has come to me , saying , 21 ‘ Tell the house of Israel : “ This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says , ‘ I am about to profane my sanctuary , the source of your great pride , the thing dear to you and the desire of your heart . Your own sons and daughters whom you left behind will fall by the sword . 22 Then you will have to do just as I have done . You will not cover over your mustache , and you will not eat the bread brought to you by others . 23 Your turbans will be on your heads and your sandals on your feet . You will not mourn or weep . Instead , you will rot away in your errors , and you will groan to one another . 24 Ezekiel has become a sign for you . Just as he has done , you will do . When it happens , you will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah . ’ ” ’ ”
Jesus told his disciples : “ You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a witness to them and the nations . ” ( Matt . 10 :18 ) It is a privilege to represent Jesus in this way . Our efforts to defend the good news may result in legal victories . Of course , what imperfect men decide does not ‘ legally establish ’ the good news in a complete sense .

18 :12-17—Why did Proconsul Gallio not interfere when onlookers began beating Sosthenes ? Gallio perhaps thought that the man who seemed to be the leader of the mob action against Paul was getting what he deserved . However , this incident apparently had a good outcome in that it led to Sosthenes ’ conversion to Christianity . Later , Paul speaks of Sosthenes as “ our brother . ” —1 Cor . 1 :1 .

11 As it turned out , our first parents chose to disobey . Satan ’ s tempting promise— “ your eyes will be opened and you will be like God , knowing good and bad ” —proved to be irresistible for Eve . ( Gen . 3 :5 ) Did Adam and Eve ’ s choice eventually enhance their freedom in any way ? Sadly , it did not . Their choice did not bring them what Satan said it would . In fact , they soon learned that rejecting Jehovah ’ s direction and going their own way resulted in disaster . ( Gen . 3 :16-19 ) Why ? Simply because Jehovah did not give humans the freedom to determine for themselves what is good and what is bad .—Read Proverbs 20 :24 and footnote ; Jeremiah 10 :23 .
19 In the course of events , while A·polʹlos was in Corinth , Paul went through the inland regions and came down to Ephʹe·sus . There he found some disciples 2 and said to them : “ Did you receive holy spirit when you became believers ? ” They replied to him : “ Why , we have never heard that there is a holy spirit . ” 3 So he said : “ In what , then , were you baptized ? ” They said : “ In John ’ s baptism . ” 4 Paul said : “ John baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance , telling the people to believe in the one coming after him , that is , in Jesus . ” 5 On hearing this , they got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . 6 And when Paul laid his hands on them , the holy spirit came upon them , and they began speaking in foreign languages and prophesying . 7 There were about 12 men in all .
7 Returning to Paul ’ s words to the Colossians , we note that after mentioning his concern , he went on to point out two things that would help them to be comforted and to be united in love . First , he mentioned “ the full assurance of their understanding . ” They had to be fully convinced that their understanding of the Scriptures was correct , so that their faith would be based on a sure foundation . ( Heb . 11 :1 ) Then , he mentioned “ an accurate knowledge of the sacred secret of God . ” They needed to advance beyond a basic knowledge of the truth and have a clear understanding of the deeper things of God . ( Heb . 5 :13 , 14 ) Sound counsel indeed for the Colossians and for us today ! How , though , can we acquire such assurance and accurate knowledge ? Paul provided the key in his profound statement about Jesus Christ : “ Carefully concealed in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge . ”

6 How did Abraham and his family keep their faith strong ? They likely learned about God by listening to faithful older ones , from receiving divine revelations , or from reading reliable ancient documents . More important , they did not forget what they had learned but cherished God ’ s promises and requirements and meditated on them . Because their hope was so sure , these men and women were prepared to suffer any hardship to remain loyal to God .

Some questions to ask yourself
The King of Israel , Jehovah , is in your midst .
14 “ Now look ! I am about to die , and you well know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed . They have all come true for you . Not one word of them has failed . 15 But just as all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you have come upon you , so Jehovah will bring upon you all the calamity that he promised and will annihilate you from this good land that Jehovah your God has given you . 16 If you violate the covenant of Jehovah your God that he commanded you to keep and if you go and serve other gods and bow down to them , then Jehovah ’ s anger will blaze against you and you will quickly perish from the good land that he has given you . ”
‘ Did I not bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt ,

5 Jehovah provides excellent advice that can help you and your mate to draw closer to him and to each other . ( Psalm 25 :4 ; Isaiah 48 :17 , 18 ) He tells us : “ Let marriage be honorable among all . ” ( Hebrews 13 :4 ) Something that you view as honorable is precious and valuable . You protect it and do not take it for granted . That is how Jehovah wants us to view marriage .

14 Look ! These are just the fringes of his ways ;
16 As you learn about Jehovah , you come to love him and want to do your best to serve him . This will motivate you to say a prayer promising to serve him . The Bible says that anyone who wants to follow Jesus must “ disown himself . ” ( Mark 8 :34 ) What does that mean ? It means that you put obedience to Jehovah first in your life . What Jehovah wants is more important than your own desires and goals .—Read 1 Peter 4 :2 .
7 The apostle John wrote : “ The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ” ( 1 John 5 :19 ) Satan has this wicked world under his control and would like to control Jehovah ’ s people too . ( Micah 4 :1 ; John 15 :19 ; Revelation 12 :12 , 17 ) The Devil knows that he does not have much time left , so he is putting intense pressure on each one of us to be disloyal to God . Sometimes the Devil uses direct attacks , but at other times his attacks are more subtle .

11 How might we imitate Paul ’ s exemplary humility ? First , we must resist any temptation to expect or accept adulation for what we accomplish in Jehovah ’ s strength . Each of us does well to ask himself : ‘ How do I view the people to whom I preach ? Might I unwittingly harbor toward certain people a bias that is common in my community ? ’ Commendably , Jehovah ’ s Witnesses around the world have been analyzing their territories to determine whether there are yet more who might respond to the good news . At times , this may require learning the languages and customs of those whom society in general has marginalized . In no way should Witnesses who reach out to such ones view themselves as superior . Rather , they seek to understand each individual in order to reach his heart with the Kingdom message .

9 Continued effort is required in order “ to be readjusted ” and manifest “ the new personality . ” Paul reminded fellow believers : “ You were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires . And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude , and should put on the new personality that was created according to God ’ s will in true righteousness and loyalty . ” ( Eph . 4 :22-24 ) The expression “ continue to be made new ” indicates that putting on the new personality is an ongoing process . This is encouraging , for it assures us that regardless of how long we have been serving Jehovah , we can keep making progress in cultivating and refining the Christian qualities that make up the new personality . Yes , the Bible can continue to change our life .

17 What is the outcome if we maintain a spiritual focus ? Romans 8 :6 answers clearly : “ Setting the mind on the spirit means life and peace . ” That implies letting our mind be influenced by and dominated by holy spirit and being in harmony with God and his thoughts . We can trust that by making “ the spirit ” the real center of our existence , we will have a satisfying , meaningful life now . And the lasting result is everlasting life , be that in heaven or on earth .

4 Many people seem to have a hazy idea of what integrity is . For example , when politicians boast of their integrity , they often seem to mean honesty . That quality is important , but it is only a part of integrity . As used in the Bible , integrity involves moral completeness , soundness . The Hebrew words relating to “ integrity ” come from a root meaning sound , whole , or faultless . One of these words is used regarding the sacrifices to be offered to Jehovah . An animal for sacrifice gained his approval only if it was sound , or whole . ( Read Leviticus 22 :19 , 20 . ) Jehovah strongly censured those who flouted his direction by offering lame , sick , or blind animals for sacrifice .—Mal . 1 :6-8 .
Now I will magnify myself .
6 Paul helped the Corinthians to see why relief work was part of their ministry and worship to Jehovah . Note his reasoning : Christians who provide relief do so because they are “ submissive to the good news about the Christ . ” ( 2 Cor . 9 :13 ) Hence , moved by their desire to put Christ ’ s teachings into practice , Christians help fellow believers . The kind acts that they perform in behalf of their brothers , stated Paul , are nothing less than expressions of “ the surpassing undeserved kindness of God . ” ( 2 Cor . 9 :14 ; 1 Pet . 4 :10 ) Thus , in commenting on serving our brothers in need , which includes relief work , The Watchtower of December 1 , 1975 , rightly stated : “ We should never doubt that Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ give real importance to this kind of service . ” Yes , relief work is a valuable form of sacred service .—Rom . 12 :1 , 7 ; 2 Cor . 8 :7 ; Heb . 13 :16 .

They are devouring people . They are seizing treasure and precious things . They have made many widows within her . 26 Her priests have violated my law , and they keep profaning my holy places . They make no distinction between what is holy and what is common , and they fail to make known what is unclean and what is clean , and they refuse to observe my sabbaths , and I am profaned among them . 27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing prey ; they shed blood and kill people to make dishonest gain . 28 But her prophets have plastered over their deeds with whitewash . They see false visions and give lying divination , and they say : “ This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says , ” when Jehovah himself has not spoken . 29 The people of the land have defrauded and committed robbery , they have mistreated the needy and the poor , and they have defrauded the foreign resident and denied him justice . ’

12 The king said to Queen Esther : “ In Shuʹshan the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and the ten sons of Haʹman . What , then , have they done in the rest of the king ’ s provinces ? What is your petition now ? It will be granted you . And what is your further request ? It will be done . ” 13 Esther replied : “ If it pleases the king , let the Jews who are in Shuʹshan be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today ’ s law ; and let the ten sons of Haʹman be hanged on the stake . ” 14 So the king gave orders for that to be done . A law was issued in Shuʹshan , and the ten sons of Haʹman were hanged .
Jehovah is an awe-inspiring Creator . Everything he creates meets the highest standards . ( Jer . 10 :12 ) As is evident in creation , Jehovah lovingly set boundaries . He made both natural laws and moral laws to ensure that everything functions harmoniously . ( Ps . 19 :7-9 ) Hence , all things in the universe have an assigned place and function according to their role in God ’ s purpose . Jehovah sets the standard for how his creation should work together . Thus , the law of gravity holds the atmosphere close to the earth , regulates tides and oceans , and contributes to the physical order essential to life on earth . All creation , including humans , moves and functions within these boundaries . Clearly , the order in creation testifies that God has a purpose for earth and mankind . In our ministry , can we draw attention to the Cause of this impressive order ? —Rev . 4 :11 . w17 .02 1 :4 , 5

At James 2 :26 , we read : “ Faith without works is dead . ”

4 How the Witnessing Is Done : Those involved in special metropolitan public witnessing usually wait for someone to come to the table or mobile display . When someone approaches , he is invited to take any literature that interests him . The pioneers gladly answer from the Scriptures any questions he may have . If he takes literature , the pioneers do not mention the donation arrangement . But if he inquires about how our work is funded , they may explain that donations can be sent to the address listed in the literature . When possible , they ask : “ Would you like someone to visit your home ? ” or “ Are you aware that a free Bible study comes with that publication ? ”

Or if it were grape gatherers who would come to you ,
17 As we discussed in Chapter 3 , Jesus was mild and humble . ( Matthew 11 :29 ) Mildness is a beautiful quality , powerful proof of the humility in a person ’ s heart . It is part of the fruitage of God ’ s holy spirit and is associated with godly wisdom . ( Galatians 5 :22 , 23 ; James 3 :13 ) Even under the worst provocation , Jesus maintained control of himself . His mildness was anything but weakness . One scholar said of this quality : “ Behind the gentleness there is the strength of steel . ” Indeed , it often takes strength for us to restrain our temper and treat others with mildness . But with Jehovah blessing our efforts , we can imitate Jesus in showing mildness , and that will make us more approachable .

16 . What command does the Bible give about marriage ?
10 During the more than 1 ,900 years since Jesus ’ resurrection , Jehovah has tolerated further the “ vessels of wrath , ” holding off their destruction . Why ? For one thing , because he has been preparing those who are to be associated with Jesus Christ in his heavenly Kingdom . These are 144 ,000 in number , and they are the “ vessels of mercy ” spoken of by the apostle Paul . First , individuals from among the Jews were invited to make up this heavenly class . Later , God invited people of the Gentile nations . Jehovah has not forced any of these to serve him . But from among those who responded appreciatively to his loving provisions , he gave some the privilege of being corulers with his Son in the heavenly Kingdom . The preparation of that heavenly class is now nearly complete .—Luke 22 :29 ; Revelation 14 :1-4 .

13 Then Tatʹte·nai the governor of the region Beyond the River , Sheʹthar-bozʹe·nai , and their colleagues promptly carried out everything that King Da·riʹus had ordered . 14 And the elders of the Jews continued building and making progress , urged on by the prophesying of Hagʹgai the prophet and Zech·a·riʹah the grandson of Idʹdo ; they finished building it by the order of the God of Israel and by the order of Cyrus and Da·riʹus and King Ar·ta·xerxʹes of Persia . 15 They completed the house by the third day of the month of Aʹdar , in the sixth year of the reign of King Da·riʹus .
The divine name in the ancient Hebrew letters used before the Babylonian exile
Those who say that the divine name should not be used because it is not known exactly how to pronounce it will nevertheless freely use the name Jesus . However , Jesus ’ first-century disciples said his name quite differently from the way most Christians do today . To Jewish Christians , the name Jesus was probably pronounced Ye·shuʹa‛ . And the title “ Christ ” was Ma·shiʹach , or “ Messiah . ” Greek-speaking Christians called him I·e·sousʹ Khri·stosʹ , and Latin-speaking Christians Ieʹsus Chriʹstus . Under inspiration , the Greek translation of his name was recorded in the Bible , showing that first-century Christians followed the sensible course of using the form of the name common in their language . Similarly , the New World Bible Translation Committee feels that it is reasonable to use the form “ Jehovah , ” even though that rendering is not exactly the way the divine name would have been pronounced in ancient Hebrew .
Mt 13 :41 send his a . , they will collect
17 So the Levites appointed Heʹman the son of Joel and , of his brothers , Aʹsaph the son of Ber·e·chiʹah and , of the Me·rarʹites their brothers , Eʹthan the son of Kush·aʹiah . 18 Together with them were their brothers of the second division , Zech·a·riʹah , Ben , Ja·aʹzi·el , She·mirʹa·moth , Je·hiʹel , Unʹni , E·liʹab , Be·naiʹah , Ma·a·seiʹah , Mat·ti·thiʹah , E·liphʹe·le·hu , and Mik·neʹiah and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·iʹel the gatekeepers . 19 The singers Heʹman , Aʹsaph , and Eʹthan were to play the copper cymbals ; 20 and Zech·a·riʹah , Aʹzi·el , She·mirʹa·moth , Je·hiʹel , Unʹni , E·liʹab , Ma·a·seiʹah , and Be·naiʹah played stringed instruments tuned to Alʹa·moth ; 21 and Mat·ti·thiʹah , E·liphʹe·le·hu , Mik·neʹiah , Oʹbed-eʹdom , Je·iʹel , and Az·a·ziʹah played harps tuned to Shemʹi·nith , to act as directors . 22 Chen·a·niʹah the chief of the Levites supervised the transport , for he was an expert , 23 and Ber·e·chiʹah and El·kaʹnah were gatekeepers for the Ark . 24 The priests Sheb·a·niʹah , Joshʹa·phat , Ne·thanʹel , A·maʹsai , Zech·a·riʹah , Be·naiʹah , and E·li·eʹzer loudly sounded the trumpets before the Ark of the true God , and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·hiʹah also served as gatekeepers for the Ark .
1-3 . ( a ) What terrifying experience did the disciples have on the Sea of Galilee , and what did Jesus do ? ( b ) Why is Jesus rightly called “ Christ the power of God ” ?
18 Jesus manifested flawless judgment in his dealings with others . His insight into human nature gave him a clear-sighted view of his disciples . He well knew that they were not perfect . Yet , he discerned their good qualities . He saw the potential in these men whom Jehovah had drawn . ( John 6 :44 ) Despite their shortcomings , Jesus showed a willingness to trust them . Demonstrating that trust , he delegated a heavy responsibility to his disciples . He commissioned them to preach the good news , and he had confidence in their ability to fulfill that commission . ( Matthew 28 :19 , 20 ) The book of Acts testifies that they faithfully followed through on the work he had commanded them to do . ( Acts 2 :41 , 42 ; 4 :33 ; 5 :27-32 ) Clearly , then , Jesus had been wise to trust them .

20 There are , therefore , compelling reasons to love our God and to let that love grow . Will you continue to strengthen your love for God , allowing him to direct your ways ? The choice is up to you . Moses recognized the benefits of cultivating and maintaining love for Jehovah . To the Israelites of long ago , Moses said : “ You must choose life in order that you may keep alive , you and your offspring , by loving Jehovah your God , by listening to his voice and by sticking to him ; for he is your life and the length of your days . ” —Deuteronomy 30 :19 , 20 .

Children who have just arrived in the Netherlands usually first go to an international preparatory class to learn Dutch . After approximately one year , they go to an ordinary class in secondary school . Unfortunately , not all children succeed in going to an ordinary class before they turn 18 years old .

25 “ Continue reminding them to be in subjection and to be obedient to governments and authorities . ” ( Titus 3 :1 ) In many lands , the possession or use of certain drugs is a violation of the law . As true Christians , we do not possess or use illegal drugs .—Romans 13 :1 .
The ark that Noah built was gigantic—longer than a football field and as high as a three-story building . It was more than 100 feet [ 30 m ] longer than the schooner Wyoming , which was reportedly the largest wooden-hulled ship ever built . Of course , the ark was not a ship ; it needed only to float . Nevertheless , it required advanced construction techniques . And it had to be covered inside and outside with tar . It may have taken more than 50 years to build .—Genesis 6 :14-16 .
3 Then Solʹo·mon started to build the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem on Mount Mo·riʹah , where Jehovah had appeared to his father David , in the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Orʹnan the Jebʹu·site . 2 He started to build on the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign . 3 And the foundation that Solʹo·mon laid for building the house of the true God was 60 cubits long and 20 cubits wide , according to the former measurement . 4 The porch in front was 20 cubits long , corresponding to the width of the house , and its height was 120 ; and he overlaid it inside with pure gold . 5 He paneled the great house with juniper wood , after which he covered it with fine gold , and then he decorated it with palm-tree figures and chains . 6 Further , he overlaid the house with beautiful precious stones ; and the gold he used was gold from Par·vaʹim . 7 He covered the house , the rafters , the thresholds , its walls , and its doors with gold ; and he engraved cherubs on the walls .
19 But long after a person has repented of a sin , he may still feel guilty about what he has done . Feelings of guilt can be painful and can make someone feel worthless . If this is how you feel at times , remember that you can not change what happened in the past . Whether or not you clearly understood at the time what was right or wrong , Jehovah completely forgave you , and those sins were erased . You are clean before Jehovah and know that you are now doing what is right . Your heart may still condemn you , but the Bible says : “ God is greater than our hearts . ” ( Read 1 John 3 :19 , 20 . ) This means that his love and forgiveness are stronger than any feelings of guilt or shame we may have . You can be sure that Jehovah has forgiven you . When a person accepts Jehovah ’ s forgiveness , his conscience will be at peace and he can be happy serving God .—1 Corinthians 6 :11 ; Hebrews 10 :22 .
9 . Why do you trust that God is always just ?
13 Do not lose heart , even if the road you travel gets bumpy at times . ( 2 Tim . 4 :2 ) When difficulties arise , stick to your goals . Katharina was 17 years old when she made it her goal to witness to each colleague at work . One person insulted her several times , but she refused to be intimidated . Her fine conduct in the face of difficulties impressed another colleague named Hans . As a result , he read our publications , studied the Bible , and got baptized . Katharina had moved away and did not know all of this . Imagine her joy when 13 years later she was sitting in the Kingdom Hall with her family and Hans was introduced as the visiting speaker ! How good that Katharina did not give up on her goal to witness to her workmates !

8 “ There will be great earthquakes . ” ( Luke 21 :11 ) According to the U .S . Geological Survey , an average of 19 major earthquakes are expected per year . These are powerful enough to damage buildings and crack the ground . And on an average , earthquakes strong enough to cause total destruction of buildings have occurred yearly . Available records show that earthquakes have claimed over two million lives since 1900 . One source states : “ Improvements in technology have only slightly reduced the death toll . ”

13 This is the third time I am coming to you . “ On the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter must be established . ” 2 Although I am absent now , it is as if I were present for the second time , and I give my warning in advance to those who sinned previously and to all the rest , that if ever I come again I will not spare them , 3 since you are seeking proof that Christ , who is not weak toward you but strong among you , is really speaking through me . 4 For , indeed , he was executed on the stake because of weakness , but he is alive because of God ’ s power . True , we also are weak with him , but we will live together with him because of God ’ s power toward you .
2 We always thank God when we mention all of you in our prayers , 3 for we continually remember your faithful work , your loving labor , and your endurance because of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father . 4 For we know , brothers loved by God , his choosing of you , 5 because the good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and with strong conviction , just as you know what sort of men we became among you for your sakes . 6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord , seeing that you accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit , 7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Mac·e·doʹni·a and in A·chaʹia .

10 Effective use of illustrations . “ Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations , ” we are told . “ Indeed , without an illustration he would not speak to them . ” ( Matthew 13 :34 ) We can not help but marvel at his matchless ability to teach profound truths through everyday things . Farmers planting seeds , women preparing to bake bread , children playing in the marketplace , fishermen hauling in nets , shepherds searching for lost sheep—these were things his listeners had seen many times . When important truths are tied in with familiar things , such truths are etched quickly and deeply on the mind and heart .—Matthew 11 :16-19 ; 13 :3-8 , 33 , 47-50 ; 18 :12-14 .

There is no real or true God but Jehovah ; no other god is like him . ( 2 Sam . 7 :22 ) Thus , Moses was reminding the Israelites that their worship of Jehovah must be exclusive . They were not to follow the peoples around them , who worshipped various gods and goddesses . Some of those false gods were viewed as ruling over certain parts of nature . Others were separate forms of a particular deity . For example , the Egyptians worshipped the sun-god Ra , the sky-goddess Nut , the earth-god Geb , the Nile-god Hapi , and numerous sacred animals . Many of these false gods were dealt devastating blows by Jehovah through the Ten Plagues . The prominent Canaanite god was Baal , the god of fertility , who also appeared as the god of the sky , rain , and storm . In many places , Baal was the local patron deity as well . ( Num . 25 :3 ) The Israelites were to remember that their God , the “ true God , ” is “ one Jehovah . ” —Deut . 4 :35 , 39 . w16 .06 3 :4 , 5
Social and Emotional : He wants to please friends and be like friends . He is more likely to agree with rules , likes to sing , dance , and act and is aware of gender . He shows more independence ( for example , may visit a next - door neighbour by himself ) but adult supervision is still needed . He is sometimes demanding and sometimes very cooperative .
19 Aʹmon was 22 years old when he became king , and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Me·shulʹle·meth the daughter of Haʹruz from Jotʹbah . 20 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah ’ s eyes , just as his father Ma·nasʹseh had done . 21 He kept walking in all the ways that his father walked , and he continued serving and bowing down to the disgusting idols that his father had served . 22 So he abandoned Jehovah the God of his forefathers , and he did not walk in the way of Jehovah . 23 Eventually Aʹmon ’ s servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house . 24 But the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against King Aʹmon , and they made his son Jo·siʹah king in his place . 25 As for the rest of the history of Aʹmon , what he did , is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah ? 26 So they buried him in his grave in the garden of Uzʹza , and his son Jo·siʹah became king in his place .
12 The western boundary was at the Great Sea and its coast . This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah by their families on all sides .
7 While these were on their way , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed being tossed by the wind ? 8 What , then , did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft garments ? Why , those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings . 9 Really , then , why did you go out ? To see a prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and far more than a prophet . 10 This is the one about whom it is written : ‘ Look ! I am sending my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way ahead of you ! ’ 11 Truly I say to you , among those born of women , there has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist , but a lesser person in the Kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is . 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now , the Kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press , and those pressing forward are seizing it . 13 For all , the Prophets and the Law , prophesied until John ; 14 and if you are willing to accept it , he is ‘ E·liʹjah who is to come . ’ 15 Let the one who has ears listen .
Do not view progress simply in terms of privileges of service that are granted to you . Your advancement is seen , not in the assignment , but in what you do with it . If given an assignment that involves teaching , ask yourself : ‘ Did I really employ the art of teaching ? Did I handle the material in such a way that it made a difference in the lives of those who heard it ? ’
Or let them hear and say , ‘ It is the truth ! ’ ”

9 Now in the city was a man named Simon , who prior to this had been practicing magical arts and amazing the nation of Sa·marʹi·a , claiming that he was somebody great . 10 All of them , from the least to the greatest , would pay attention to him and say : “ This man is the Power of God , which is called Great . ” 11 So they would pay attention to him because he had amazed them for quite a while by his magical arts . 12 But when they believed Philip , who was declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ , both men and women were getting baptized . 13 Simon himself also became a believer , and after being baptized , he continued with Philip ; and he was amazed at seeing the signs and great powerful works taking place .

16 So Pharʹaoh quickly called Moses and Aaron and said : “ I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you . 17 Now , please , pardon my sin just this once , and plead with Jehovah your God that he just remove this deadly plague from upon me . ” 18 So he went out from Pharʹaoh and pleaded with Jehovah . 19 Then Jehovah caused the wind to shift , and it became a very stiff west wind , and it carried the locusts away and drove them into the Red Sea . Not a single locust remained in all the territory of Egypt . 20 However , Jehovah allowed Pharʹaoh ’ s heart to become obstinate , and he did not send the Israelites away .
Jehovah is , in effect , being taunted by his archenemy , the Devil . God has every reason to be wrathful over such deliberate insults , yet the Bible describes Jehovah as being “ slow to anger . ” ( Ex . 34 :6 ) When we strive to imitate God ’ s slowness to anger and his mildness , we follow a course of wisdom that pleases Jehovah greatly .—Eph . 5 :1 .
2 Our loving heavenly Father came to the aid of his servants in the past , and today he makes it possible for us to gain considerable relief from distress or anxiety . The Bible urges us : “ Throw all your anxiety [ “ cares ; worries , ” ftn . ] on him , because he cares for you . ” ( 1 Pet . 5 :7 ) How , though , can you do that ? Let us consider four ways that you can do so—by means of heartfelt prayer , by reading God ’ s Word and meditating on it , by tapping into Jehovah ’ s holy spirit , and by sharing your feelings with a trusted confidant . As we examine these four ways , see if you can identify practical steps that you want to take .
4 Jehovah , however , expressed his love toward fallen mankind in an incomparable act of undeserved kindness . He sent his greatest gift of all , “ his only-begotten Son , ” to earth to die in our behalf . ( John 3 :16 ) So Paul wrote concerning Jesus that he is “ now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death , so that by God ’ s undeserved kindness he might taste death for everyone . ” ( Heb . 2 :9 ) Yes , “ the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord . ” —Rom . 6 :23b .

Toward noon , I started climbing back down the same way I had come up . But the dismantling had changed things , and I stepped into air—and down I went .

53 Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt ended , 54 and the seven years of famine began , just as Joseph had said . The famine developed in all the lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread . 55 Eventually , all the land of Egypt suffered from the famine , and the people began to cry to Pharʹaoh for bread . Then Pharʹaoh said to all the Egyptians : “ Go to Joseph , and do whatever he tells you . ” 56 The famine continued over all the surface of the earth . Then Joseph began to open up all the granaries that were among them and to sell to the Egyptians , as the famine had a strong grip on the land of Egypt . 57 Moreover , people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy from Joseph , because the famine had a strong grip on all the earth .
2 But Jehovah will listen to us only if we talk to him in the way he approves . How can we do that ? Let ’ s see what the Bible says about prayer .
13 After they had departed , look ! Jehovah ’ s angel appeared to Joseph in a dream , saying : “ Get up , take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt , and stay there until I give you word , for Herod is about to search for the young child to kill him . ” 14 So Joseph got up and by night took along the young child and the child ’ s mother and went into Egypt . 15 He stayed there until the death of Herod . This fulfilled what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet , saying : “ Out of Egypt I called my son . ”

Ten days after Jesus left the apostles and returned to God in heaven , some 3 ,000 people are baptized in Jerusalem .

So some of Jesus ’ disciples use their own money to take care of them .

15 When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys who were shouting in the temple , “ Save , we pray , the Son of David ! ” they became indignant 16 and said to him : “ Do you hear what these are saying ? ” Jesus said to them : “ Yes .

By Friday evening , families arrived for the two-day assembly . They came on foot , by horse , and by truck . Some little boys and girls had walked for six hours in plastic sandals . They risked land mines at the river crossings and braved leeches in the quiet waters . Some from distant communities brought with them just a little food—rice flavored with pork fat . Why had they all come ?

7 We should be humble and respectful as we pray to Jehovah . Why ? If we were to speak to a king or a president , we would do so in a respectful way . Jehovah is Almighty God , so shouldn ’ t we show even more respect and humility when we speak to him ? ( Genesis 17 :1 ; Psalm 138 :6 ) We should also be sincere and pray to Jehovah from our heart , not just repeating the same words over and over again .—Matthew 6 :7 , 8 .

10 Then David praised Jehovah before the eyes of all the congregation . David said : “ May you be praised , O Jehovah the God of Israel our father , throughout all eternity . 11 Yours , O Jehovah , are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty , for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours . Yours is the kingdom , O Jehovah . You are the One exalting yourself as head over all . 12 The riches and the glory are from you , and you rule over everything , and in your hand there are power and mightiness , and your hand is able to make great and to give strength to all . 13 And now , O our God , we thank you and praise your beautiful name .
9 As we learned in Chapter 7 , the apostle John was given a vision where he saw Jesus as King in heaven with 144 ,000 other kings . Who are the 144 ,000 ? John explains that they “ have [ Jesus ’ ] name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads . ” And he adds : “ These are the ones who keep following the Lamb [ that is , Jesus ] no matter where he goes . These were bought from among mankind . ” ( Read Revelation 14 :1 , 4 . ) The 144 ,000 are faithful Christians whom God has chosen “ to rule as kings over the earth ” with Jesus . When they die , they are resurrected to life in heaven . ( Revelation 5 :10 ) Since the time of the apostles , Jehovah has been choosing faithful Christians to be part of that group of 144 ,000 kings .

4 Ben-haʹdad listened to King Aʹsa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel , and they struck down Iʹjon , Dan , Aʹbel-maʹim , and all the storage places of the cities of Naphʹta·li . 5 When Baʹa·sha heard of it , he immediately quit building Raʹmah and abandoned his work on it . 6 King Aʹsa then took all Judah , and they carried off the stones and timbers of Raʹmah that Baʹa·sha had been building with , and with them he built up Geʹba and Mizʹpah .

19 Sometimes , though , we might wonder , ‘ Why hasn ’ t Jehovah answered my prayers yet ? ’ Remember , he knows when and how to answer our prayers . He knows what we need . We may have to keep on praying for a time to show that we really mean what we say to him and to show him that we truly have faith in him . ( Luke 11 :5-10 ) Sometimes Jehovah answers our prayers in a way that we may not expect . For example , we may pray about a difficult situation , but instead of removing the problem , he may give us the strength to endure it .—Read Philippians 4 :13 .

6 From your rebuke , O God of Jacob ,
The Pharisees take exception to Jesus ’ statement and say : “ You bear witness about yourself ; your witness is not true . ” Jesus replies : “ Even if I do bear witness about myself , my witness is true , because I know where I came from and where I am going . But you do not know where I came from and where I am going . ” He adds : “ In your own Law it is written : ‘ The witness of two men is true . ’ I am one who bears witness about myself , and the Father who sent me bears witness about me . ” —John 8 :13-18 .

But now it has been revealed to his holy ones , 27 to whom God has been pleased to make known among the nations the glorious riches of this sacred secret , which is Christ in union with you , the hope of his glory . 28 He is the one we are proclaiming , admonishing everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom , so that we may present every person complete in union with Christ . 29 To this end I am indeed working hard , exerting myself with his strength that is operating powerfully within me .

7 Jesus continued his Sermon on the Mount by saying : “ Happy are the mild-tempered ones , since they will inherit the earth . ” ( Matthew 5 :5 ) Mildness of temper is sometimes thought to imply weakness of character . However , that is not the case . Explaining the sense of the word translated “ mild-tempered , ” one Bible scholar wrote : “ The supreme characteristic of the man who is [ mild of temper ] is that he is the man who is under perfect control . It is not a spineless gentleness , a sentimental fondness , a passive quietism . It is a strength under control . ” Jesus stated about himself : “ I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart . ” ( Matthew 11 :29 ) Yet , Jesus was courageous in defending righteous principles .—Matthew 21 :12 , 13 ; 23 :13-33 .

12 Consider a recent decision made by the Governing Body . “ Questions From Readers ” in The Watchtower of November 15 , 2014 , outlined an adjustment in how elders and ministerial servants are appointed . The article noted that the first-century governing body authorized traveling overseers to make such appointments . In line with that pattern , since September 1 , 2014 , circuit overseers have been appointing elders and ministerial servants . The circuit overseer tries to get to know the men who are recommended and to work with them in the field service if possible . He also observes the family of the brother under consideration . ( 1 Tim . 3 :4 , 5 ) The body of elders and the circuit overseer carefully consider the Scriptural qualifications for ministerial servants and elders .—1 Tim . 3 :1-10 , 12 , 13 ; 1 Pet . 5 :1-3 .

We settled in what was then West Germany . In time , I developed a love for the Bible . On Sundays , I would go into the woods to read the Bible , but what I read seemed so foreign , so far in the past . I was also attending catechism classes in preparation for baptism as a Mennonite . I was shocked when I found in the catechism book the statement : “ The Father is God , the Son is God , and the Holy Spirit is God , ” followed by the question : “ Are there three Gods ? ” The answer was printed below : “ No , these three are one . ” I asked the minister how that could be possible . His response was , “ Young man , one should not think too deeply on these matters ; some have lost their minds as a result of delving too deeply . ” Right then , I decided not to get baptized .

3 Some people say that God accepts all religions , but that ’ s not what Jesus taught us . He said : “ Not everyone saying to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens , but only the one doing the will of my Father . ” So it is necessary for us to learn what the will of God is and then to do it . This is a serious matter because Jesus compared people who do not obey God to criminals , “ workers of lawlessness . ” —Matthew 7 :21-23 .

( John 14 :12 ) He trained them thoroughly , and they spread the good news throughout the then-known world .—Col . 1 :23 .

PETER would never forget that terrible moment when their eyes met . Did he see in Jesus ’ gaze some hint of disappointment or reproach ? We can not venture so far ; the inspired record says only that “ the Lord turned and looked upon Peter . ” ( Luke 22 :61 ) But in that one glance , Peter saw the depth of his own failure . He realized that he had just done the very thing that Jesus had foretold , the one thing that Peter had insisted he would never do—he had disowned his beloved Master . It was a low point for Peter , perhaps the worst moment of the worst day of his life .

Rather , Jesus keeps on teaching publicly in Jerusalem , saying : “ I will be with you a little while longer before I go to the One who sent me . You will look for me , but you will not find me , and where I am you can not come . ” ( John 7 :33 , 34 ) The Jews do not understand , so they say among themselves : “ Where does this man intend to go , so that we will not find him ? He does not intend to go to the Jews dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks , does he ? What does he mean when he says , ‘ You will look for me , but you will not find me , and where I am you can not come ’ ? ” ( John 7 :35 , 36 ) Jesus , however , is speaking of his death and resurrection to heaven , and his enemies can not follow him there .

4 So Jonʹa·than spoke well of David to his father Saul . He said to him : “ The king should not sin against his servant David , for he has not sinned against you and what he has done for you has benefited you . 5 He risked his life to strike down the Phi·lisʹtine , so that Jehovah brought about a great victory for all Israel . You saw it , and you were overjoyed . So why should you sin against innocent blood in having David put to death for no reason ? ” 6 Saul listened to Jonʹa·than , and Saul swore : “ As surely as Jehovah is living , he will not be put to death . ” 7 Afterward Jonʹa·than called David and told him all these things . So Jonʹa·than brought David to Saul , and he continued to serve him as before .

3 Some have had images or shrines in their home for years . Is that true of you ? If so , you might feel that it is strange or wrong to pray to God without such a visible aid . You may even feel attached to some of these items . But God is the one who says how he should be worshipped , and the Bible teaches that he does not want us to use images . ( Read Exodus 20 :4 , 5 ; Psalm 115 :4-8 ; Isaiah 42 :8 ; 1 John 5 :21 ) So you can take a stand for true worship by destroying any items you own that are connected with false worship . By all means , come to view them as Jehovah does—as something “ detestable . ” —Deuteronomy 27 :15 .

15 When Judah caught sight of her , he at once took her for a prostitute , because she had covered her face . 16 So he turned aside to her by the road and said : “ Allow me , please , to have relations with you , ” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law . However , she said : “ What will you give me that you may have relations with me ? ” 17 To this he said : “ I will send a young goat from my herd . ” But she said : “ Will you give a security until you send it ? ” 18 He continued : “ What security should I give you ? ” to which she said : “ Your seal ring and your cord and your rod that is in your hand . ” Then he gave them to her and had relations with her , and she became pregnant by him . 19 After that she got up and went away and removed her shawl and clothed herself with her widow ’ s clothing .

Jesus told his apostles to go to Galilee , where they would meet him again . When they arrived , Peter decided to go out fishing on the Sea of Galilee . Several others accompanied him . Once again , Peter found himself on the lake where he had spent much of his earlier life . The creaking of the boat , the lapping of the waves , the feel of the coarse nets in his hands must all have seemed comfortingly familiar . Did he wonder that night just how he should direct his life now that Jesus ’ earthly ministry was over ? Did the simple life of a fisherman beckon ? In any case , they caught no fish all that night .—Matthew 26 :32 ; John 21 :1-3 .

As the number of pioneers increased sharply , responsible brothers considered practical ways to support this growing army . Jim Carr , serving as a zone servant ( now known as a circuit overseer ) in 1938 , followed the suggestion to set up pioneer homes in cities . Groups of pioneers were encouraged to live and work together , thus cutting costs . In Sheffield , they rented a large house , to be overseen by a responsible brother . The local congregation contributed funds and furniture . Jim recalled : “ Everyone worked to make it a success . ” Ten hardworking pioneers lived there , keeping up a good spiritual routine . “ The [ day ’ s ] text was discussed each morning at the breakfast table , ” and “ the pioneers went daily to their territory in various parts of the city . ”

19 Then they said : “ Look ! There is a festival of Jehovah from year to year in Shiʹloh , which is north of Bethʹel and east of the highway that goes up from Bethʹel to Sheʹchem and south of Le·boʹnah . ” 20 So they commanded the men of Benjamin : “ Go and set an ambush in the vineyards . 21 And when you see the young women of Shiʹloh come out to join in their circle dances , each of you should come out from the vineyards and seize a wife from the young women of Shiʹloh , and you should return to the land of Benjamin . 22 And should their fathers or their brothers come to make a complaint against us , we will then tell them , ‘ Show us favor for their sakes , because we could not provide each one a wife by war and you could not give a wife to them without becoming guilty . ’ ”

20 When we have the smile of approval of “ the happy God , ” we can be happy despite religious persecution , opposition at home , sickness , or advanced age . ( 1 Tim . 1 :11 ) We also experience happiness because of the precious promises of our God , “ who can not lie . ” ( Titus 1 :2 ) The fulfillment of Jehovah ’ s promises will be so impressive that the difficulties and trials of the present time will pale into insignificance . In the coming Paradise , the blessings from Jehovah will surpass our imagination . And we will certainly experience unprecedented happiness . Yes , we “ will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace . ” —Ps . 37 :11 .

21 “ If someone is found slain in a field of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess and it is not known who killed him , 2 your elders and judges should go out and measure the distance from the dead body to the cities that surround it . 3 Then the elders of the city nearest to the body should take from the herd a young cow that has never been put to work , that has never pulled in a yoke , 4 and the elders of that city should lead the young cow down to a valley running with water where no tilling or sowing of seed has been done , and they should break the neck of the young cow there in the valley .

So the crowd is divided . Though some want Jesus arrested , no one lays a hand on him . When the officers return to the religious leaders without Jesus , the chief priests and Pharisees ask : “ Why did you not bring him in ? ” The officers reply : “ Never has any man spoken like this . ” The religious leaders angrily resort to ridicule and name-calling : “ You have not been misled also , have you ? Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him , has he ? But this crowd who do not know the Law are accursed people . ” —John 7 :45-49 .
Jesus showed that his disciples would be rewarded for their sacrifices ( See paragraph 5 )
13 However , many of God ’ s servants have already died because of illness , persecution , and other factors . ( Matt . 24 :9 ) How , then , will all of these be delivered ? As noted earlier , “ there is going to be a resurrection of . . . the righteous . ” ( Acts 24 :15 ) What comfort there is in knowing that nothing can prevent Jehovah from delivering his servants !

44 On that day men were appointed over the storehouses for the contributions , the firstfruits , and the tenths . Into them they were to gather from the fields of the cities the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites , for there was rejoicing in Judah because of the priests and the Levites who were ministering . 45 And they began taking care of the duties of their God and the obligation of the purification , as did the singers and the gatekeepers , according to the instructions of David and his son Solʹo·mon . 46 For long ago in the days of David and Aʹsaph , there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God . 47 And during the days of Ze·rubʹba·bel and during the days of Ne·he·miʹah , all Israel gave portions to the singers and the gatekeepers , according to the daily need . They also set aside the portion for the Levites , and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron .

17 The Bible lists the various parts of the suit of spiritual armor we need in our fight against Satan and this world . A prominent piece of the armor is the helmet , “ the hope of salvation . ” ( 1 Thessalonians 5 :8 ) A soldier in Bible times knew that he would not last long in battle without his helmet . Often made of metal and fitted over a cap of felt or leather , the helmet ensured that most blows directed at the head would glance off with little harm done . As a helmet protects the head , hope can protect your mind , your thinking .

8 A few months later , in September 1938 , the Cantwell family appeared before the trial court in New Haven . Newton , Russell , and Jesse were convicted of soliciting donations without a license . Despite appeals to the Supreme Court of Connecticut , Jesse was found guilty of inciting a breach of peace—of being a troublemaker . Why ? Because the two Catholic men who had listened to the record testified in court that the lecture insulted their religion and provoked them . To challenge the convictions , the responsible brothers in our organization appealed to the U .S . Supreme Court—the highest court of the land .
32 E·liʹsha was sitting in his house , and the elders were sitting with him . The king sent a man ahead of him , but before the messenger arrived , E·liʹsha said to the elders : “ Have you seen how this son of a murderer has sent to take off my head ? Watch when the messenger comes , close the door , and hold the door shut against him . Is not the sound of his lord ’ s footsteps behind him ? ” 33 While he was still speaking with them , the messenger came to him , and the king said : “ This calamity is from Jehovah . Why should I wait any longer for Jehovah ? ”
The answers to those questions are not difficult . The reason is that God ’ s servants believe that displaying Jehovah ’ s qualities is more precious in his eyes than diamonds , gold , or other material things . Yes , Jehovah ’ s view of what is precious and what is not differs from that of most humans . ( Isa . 55 :8 , 9 ) And as for his servants , reflecting Jehovah ’ s qualities in fuller measure is a priceless achievement .
Wherever they gather for worship , Jehovah ’ s Witnesses have arrangements in place for making contributions , but the specifics may vary somewhat from one land to another .

19 As we associate with other worshippers of Jehovah , we strengthen the bonds of love and friendship in the congregation . It is important that we look for the good in one another , as Jehovah looks for the good in us . Do not expect perfection from your fellow believers . Remember that all are at different stages of spiritual growth and that every one of us makes mistakes . ( Read Colossians 3 :13 . ) Seek to build close friendships with those who love Jehovah intensely , and you will find yourself growing spiritually . Yes , worshipping Jehovah with your spiritual brothers and sisters will help you to remain in God ’ s love . How does Jehovah reward those who worship him faithfully and thus remain in his love ?
And Jehovah they do not acknowledge .
10 The World Book Encyclopedia says that the early Christians “ considered the celebration of anyone ’ s birth to be a pagan custom . ” Such customs were based on false beliefs . For example , the ancient Greeks believed that every person was protected by a spirit that was present at his birth . And they thought that spirit was connected to a god born on the same date as the person . In addition to such pagan beliefs , birthdays are also connected with astrology and horoscopes .

Do you not judge those inside , 13 while God judges those outside ? “ Remove the wicked person from among yourselves . ”

Downloading our publications from anywhere but jw .org is potentially dangerous . Jehovah has entrusted the responsibility of providing spiritual food to “ the faithful and discreet slave ” alone .

13 Promoted as a celebration of Christ ’ s resurrection , Easter is actually rooted in false religion . The name Easter itself has been linked to Eostre , or Ostara , the Anglo-Saxon goddess of the dawn and of spring . And how did eggs and rabbits come to be associated with Easter ? Eggs “ have been prominent as symbols of new life and resurrection , ” says the Encyclopædia Britannica , while the hare and the rabbit have long served as symbols of fertility . Easter , therefore , is really a fertility rite thinly disguised as a celebration of Christ ’ s resurrection .

20 The lives of Joshua , David , and Timothy add proof that serving Jehovah is the best way to spend your life . The short-term material advantages of a career in this world can not approach the long-range benefits you receive from ‘ serving Jehovah with your whole heart and soul . ’ ( Josh . 22 :5 ) If you have not made a dedication to Jehovah in prayer , ask yourself , ‘ What is stopping me from becoming one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses ? ’ If you are already a baptized worshipper of Jehovah , would you like to increase your joy in living ? Then expand your ministry , and make steady spiritual progress . The following article will show you how you can grow spiritually by following the example of the apostle Paul .
54 Well , at hearing these things , they were infuriated in their hearts and began to grind their teeth at him . 55 But he , being full of holy spirit , gazed into heaven and caught sight of God ’ s glory and of Jesus standing at God ’ s right hand , 56 and he said : “ Look ! I see the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God ’ s right hand . ” 57 At this they cried out at the top of their voices and put their hands over their ears and rushed at him all together . 58 After throwing him outside the city , they began stoning him . The witnesses laid down their outer garments at the feet of a young man called Saul . 59 As they were stoning Stephen , he made this appeal : “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . ” 60 Then , kneeling down , he cried out with a strong voice : “ Jehovah , do not charge this sin against them . ” And after saying this , he fell asleep in death .

16 Then I prayed to Jehovah after giving the deed of purchase to Barʹuch the son of Ne·riʹah , saying : 17 “ Alas , O Sovereign Lord Jehovah ! Look ! You made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm . Nothing is too wonderful for you , 18 the One showing loyal love to thousands , but repaying the error of the fathers to their sons after them , the true God , the great and mighty One , whose name is Jehovah of armies . 19 You are great in counsel and mighty in deed , you whose eyes observe all the ways of men , to give to each one according to his ways and according to what he does . 20 You have performed signs and miracles in the land of Egypt , which are known down to this day , and thus you have made a name for yourself in Israel and among mankind , as it is today . 21 And you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt , with signs , with miracles , with a mighty hand , with an outstretched arm , and with terrifying deeds .

17 But the high priest rose , and all those with him , who were of the sect of the Sadducees , and they were filled with jealousy . 18 And they seized the apostles and put them in the public jail . 19 But during the night , Jehovah ’ s angel opened the doors of the prison , brought them out , and said : 20 “ Go and take your stand in the temple , and keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life . ” 21 After hearing this , they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach .

16 Children , Jesus provides an excellent example for you too . Jesus was given into the care of Joseph and Mary , and he obeyed them . ( Read Luke 2 :51 . ) He recognized that , despite their imperfections , they were entrusted with the God-given responsibility of looking after him . That being the case , they were to be honored . ( Deut . 5 :16 ; Matt . 15 :4 ) As a grown-up , Jesus always did the things pleasing to his heavenly Father . That meant resisting temptation . ( Matt . 4 :1-10 ) You youngsters may at times be tempted to disobey your parents . So , what can help you to follow Jesus ’ example ?

20 Today , the Governing Body of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses gives encouragement to Bethel family members , to special full-time field workers , and indeed , to the entire international brotherhood of true Christians . And the result is the same as in the first century—rejoicing over the encouragement ! In addition , in 2015 the Governing Body published the brochure Return to Jehovah , which has proved to be a rich source of encouragement to many throughout the world . But is it only those in authority who should imitate Jehovah in giving encouragement ? The answer to that question will be found in the following article .

4 Remember the faithful men Enoch and Noah . Why are they described as walking with God ? ( Genesis 5 :24 ; 6 :9 ) In the Bible , the term “ to walk ” often means to follow a certain course of action . Enoch and Noah chose a course in life that was in harmony with the will of Jehovah God . Unlike those in the world around them , they looked to Jehovah for guidance and obeyed his direction . They trusted in him . Does this mean that Jehovah made their decisions for them ? No . Jehovah has given humans free will , and he wants us to use that gift along with our own “ power of reason . ” ( Romans 12 :1 ) As we make decisions , however , we humbly allow our power of reason to be guided by Jehovah ’ s infinitely superior mind . ( Proverbs 3 :5 , 6 ; Isaiah 55 :8 , 9 ) In effect , as we walk through life , we take that journey in close company with Jehovah .

13 Imagine young Samuel watching , wide-eyed , as such gross abuses went on uncorrected . How many people did he see—including poor , humble , downtrodden folk—approaching that sacred tabernacle in hopes of finding some spiritual comfort and strength , only to leave disappointed , hurt , or humiliated ? And how did he feel when he learned that Hophni and Phinehas also disregarded Jehovah ’ s laws on sexual morality , as they had relations with some of the women who were serving there at the tabernacle ? ( 1 Sam . 2 :22 ) Perhaps he looked hopefully to Eli to do something about it .
24 These were the sons of Leʹvi according to their paternal houses , the heads of the paternal houses , by those registered who were counted and listed by their names and who carried out the work for the service of the house of Jehovah , from 20 years old and up . 25 For David had said : “ Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to his people , and he will reside in Jerusalem forever . 26 Also the Levites will not have to carry the tabernacle or any of its utensils for its service . ” 27 For according to the last instructions of David , the Levites from 20 years old and up were numbered . 28 Their function was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah , to be in charge of the courtyards , the dining rooms , the purification of every holy thing , and any work needed for the service of the house of the true God . 29 They assisted with the layer bread , the fine flour for the grain offering , the wafers of unleavened bread , the griddle cakes , the mixed dough , and all measures of quantity and size . 30 They were to stand morning by morning to thank and praise Jehovah and likewise in the evening . 31 They assisted whenever the burnt sacrifices were offered to Jehovah on the Sabbaths , the new moons , and during the festival seasons , according to the number required by the rules concerning them , doing so regularly before Jehovah . 32 They also took care of their responsibilities toward the tent of meeting , toward the holy place , and toward their brothers the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah .

12 Jehovah now said to Moses : “ Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , so that they may come up over the land of Egypt and eat up all the vegetation of the land , everything that the hail has let remain . ” 13 At once Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt , and Jehovah caused an east wind to blow on the land all that day and all night . The morning came , and the east wind brought the locusts . 14 And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down on the whole territory of Egypt . It was extremely severe ; never before had there been so many locusts , nor would there ever be so many again . 15 They covered the surface of the entire land , and the land grew dark with them ; they devoured all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left ; nothing green was left on the trees or on the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt .

While situations arise where outside intervention may be required in order to resolve a difference , how much better if a matter can be resolved privately ! Jesus encourages us to take the initiative in making peace with our brother , apologizing if necessary . ( Matthew 5 :23 , 24 ) It will require humility , or lowliness of mind , but Peter wrote : “ Gird yourselves with lowliness of mind toward one another , because God opposes the haughty ones , but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones . ” ( 1 Peter 5 :5 ) The way we treat fellow worshipers has a direct bearing on our relationship with God .—1 John 4 :20 .

1Co 13 :5 It does not keep a . of injury
6 The vital question for you to consider is this : How will I respond to Jehovah ’ s love ? Many will say , “ Well , I need to love Jehovah in return . ” Is that how you feel ? Jesus said that this command is the greatest of all : “ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ” ( Matthew 22 :37 ) You certainly have many reasons to love Jehovah God . But is feeling that you have such love all that is involved in loving Jehovah with your whole heart , soul , and mind ?

11 Jehovah also provided a truly remarkable demonstration of his protective power when he transferred the life of his only-begotten Son to the womb of the Jewish virgin Mary . An angel told Mary that she would “ conceive in [ her ] womb and give birth to a son . ” The angel explained : “ Holy spirit will come upon you , and power of the Most High will overshadow you . ” ( Luke 1 :31 , 35 ) Seemingly , God ’ s Son had never been so vulnerable . Would the sin and imperfection of the human mother blemish the embryo ? Would Satan be able to injure or kill that Son before He was born ? Impossible ! Jehovah formed , in effect , a protective wall around Mary so that nothing—no imperfection , no hurtful force , no murderous human , nor any demon—could damage the growing embryo , from the moment of conception on . Jehovah continued to protect Jesus during his youth . ( Matthew 2 :1-15 ) Until God ’ s appointed time , his dear Son was unassailable .

Practical wisdom differs from knowledge and understanding . A person who has knowledge accumulates information , or facts . Someone who has understanding can see how one fact relates to another . A person who has wisdom is able to combine knowledge with understanding and put them to work in a practical way .

Instead , we will treat others with dignity and put their needs and feelings ahead of our own .—Philippians 2 :3 , 4 .

6 A primary requirement is that we exercise faith . ( Read Mark 11 :24 . ) The apostle Paul wrote : “ Without faith it is impossible to please God well , for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him . ” ( Hebrews 11 :6 ) Having true faith is more than merely knowing that God exists and that he hears and answers prayers . Faith is proved by our actions . We must give clear evidence that we have faith by the way we live every day .—James 2 :26 .

7 During their celebrations , pagans exchanged gifts and feasted—practices that Christmas preserved . As is also true today , however , much Christmas giving was not in the spirit of 2 Corinthians 9 :7 , which reads : “ Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart , not grudgingly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver . ” True Christians give out of love , their giving is not tied to a date , and they expect no gifts in return . ( Luke 14 :12-14 ; read Acts 20 :35 . ) Moreover , they deeply appreciate being set free from the Christmas frenzy and relieved of the heavy yoke of financial debt that many incur at that time of year .—Matthew 11 :28-30 ; John 8 :32 .

12 The demons use another trick to trap people . They try to make us believe that it ’ s possible to talk to the dead and that those who have died are actually still alive somewhere and can communicate with us or hurt us . For example , someone whose friend or relative has died may go to a person , such as a spirit medium , who says he or she can talk to the dead . The medium may tell the person something interesting about the dead friend or relative and even imitate the dead person ’ s voice . ( 1 Samuel 28 :3-19 ) Many funeral customs are also based on the belief that the dead are still alive somewhere . These may include funeral celebrations , funeral anniversaries , sacrifices for the dead , widowhood rites , or some wake rituals . When Christians refuse to take part in these customs , their families or village communities may criticize them , insult them , or refuse to have anything to do with them . But Christians know that the dead are not alive somewhere else . It ’ s impossible to communicate with them , and they can not harm us . ( Psalm 115 :17 ) Be very careful . Never try to communicate with the dead or the demons and never get involved in demonic customs .—Read Deuteronomy 18 :10 , 11 ; Isaiah 8 :19 .

When reading deeper material , however , what you derive from your efforts may be increased by using a different method . Counseling Joshua on his reading of the Scriptures , Jehovah said : “ This book of the law should not depart from your mouth , and you must in an undertone read in it . ” ( Josh . 1 :8 ) Speaking in an undertone is often done when a person is musing . Therefore , the Hebrew term that is rendered “ in an undertone read ” is also translated “ meditate . ” ( Ps . 63 :6 ; 77 :12 ; 143 :5 ) When meditating , a person thinks deeply ; he does not rush . Reading in a contemplative manner allows God ’ s Word to have a greater impact on the mind and heart . The Bible contains prophecy , counsel , proverbs , poetry , pronouncements of divine judgment , details regarding Jehovah ’ s purpose , and an abundance of real-life examples—all valuable to those who want to walk in Jehovah ’ s ways . How beneficial to read the Bible in a manner that allows it to be deeply impressed on your mind and heart !

23 Of course , having a good marriage does not mean that a husband and wife will always agree on everything . Once , when Abraham did not agree with Sarah , Jehovah told him : “ Listen to her . ” Abraham did so , and the results were good . ( Genesis 21 :9-13 ) If at times you and your mate do not agree , don ’ t get discouraged . The important thing is that even when you disagree , you still treat each other with love and respect .
Are you a full-grown , mature Christian ? Or are you still , in some ways , like a spiritual babe ? ( Hebrews 5 :13 ) In either case , be determined to apply yourself to personal study , to preaching , and to showing love for your brothers . Welcome whatever counsel and discipline are offered you by mature ones . ( Proverbs 8 :33 ) Shoulder your full load of Christian responsibility . With time and effort , you too can “ attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God , to a full-grown man , to the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ . ” —Ephesians 4 :13 .
8 At the end of 20 years , during which Solʹo·mon built the house of Jehovah and his own house , 2 Solʹo·mon rebuilt the cities that Hiʹram had given Solʹo·mon and settled Israelites there . 3 Furthermore , Solʹo·mon went to Haʹmath-zoʹbah and captured it . 4 Then he built up Tadʹmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities that he had built in Haʹmath . 5 He also built up Upper Beth-hoʹron and Lower Beth-hoʹron , fortified cities with walls , gates , and bars , 6 and Baʹal·ath as well as all of Solʹo·mon ’ s storage cities , all the chariot cities , the cities for the horsemen , and whatever Solʹo·mon desired to build in Jerusalem , in Lebʹa·non , and in all the land of his dominion .

18 Letting “ a dragnet . . . down into the sea . ” The dragnet represents the Kingdom preaching that is taking place throughout the sea of humanity . “ Gathering fish of every kind . ” The good news attracts people of all kinds—those who take steps to become true Christians , as well as many others who may initially show some interest but do not really take a stand for pure worship . Collecting “ the fine ones into containers . ” Honesthearted ones are gathered into containerlike congregations , where they can render clean worship to Jehovah . Throwing away “ the unsuitable ” fish . Throughout the last days , Christ and the angels have been separating “ the wicked from among the righteous . ” As a result , those who lack the right heart condition—who are perhaps unwilling to abandon wrong beliefs or practices—have not been allowed to taint the congregations .

20 After all of this , when Jo·siʹah had prepared the temple , King Neʹcho of Egypt came up to fight at Carʹche·mish by the Eu·phraʹtes . Then Jo·siʹah went out against him . 21 So he sent messengers to him , saying : “ What does this have to do with you , O king of Judah ? I am not coming against you today , but my fight is against another house , and God says that I should hurry . For your own sake , refrain from opposing God , who is with me , or he will bring you to ruin . ” 22 However , Jo·siʹah would not turn away from him , but he disguised himself to fight against him and would not listen to the words of Neʹcho , which were from the mouth of God . So he came to fight in the Plain of Me·gidʹdo .
12 Now the sons of Eʹli were wicked men ; they had no regard for Jehovah . 13 This is what they did with the due right of the priests from the people : Whenever any man was offering a sacrifice , an attendant of the priest came with a three-pronged fork in his hand when the meat was boiling , 14 and he would thrust it into the basin , the two-handled cooking pot , the cauldron , or the one-handled cooking pot . Whatever the fork brought up , the priest would take for himself . That is what they would do in Shiʹloh to all the Israelites coming there . 15 Also , even before the man sacrificing could make the fat smoke , an attendant of the priest would come and say to him : “ Give the priest meat to roast . He will not take boiled meat from you , only raw meat . ” 16 When the man would say to him : “ Let them first be sure to make the fat smoke , then take for yourself whatever you desire , ” he would say : “ No , give it to me now ; if not , I will take it by force ! ” 17 Thus the sin of the attendants came to be very great before Jehovah , for the men treated the offering of Jehovah with disrespect .

JEHOVAH GOD deeply cares for us and wants us to benefit from his loving direction . If we worship him in the right way , we will be happy and will avoid many problems in life . We will also have his blessing and his help . ( Isaiah 48 :17 ) There are , however , hundreds of religions that claim to teach the truth about God . Yet , they differ greatly in their teachings about who God is and what he expects of us .

27 Now after this , he went out and saw a tax collector named Leʹvi sitting at the tax office , and he said to him : “ Be my follower . ” 28 And leaving everything behind , he rose up and began to follow him . 29 Then Leʹvi spread a big reception feast for him in his house , and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were dining with them . 30 At this the Pharisees and their scribes began murmuring to his disciples , saying : “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ” 31 In reply Jesus said to them : “ Those who are healthy do not need a physician , but those who are ill do . 32 I have come to call , not righteous people , but sinners to repentance . ”
6 So when they had assembled , they asked him : “ Lord , are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time ? ” 7 He said to them : “ It does not belong to you to know the times or seasons that the Father has placed in his own jurisdiction . 8 But you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you , and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem , in all Ju·deʹa and Sa·marʹi·a , and to the most distant part of the earth . ” 9 After he had said these things , while they were looking on , he was lifted up and a cloud caught him up from their sight . 10 And as they were gazing into the sky while he was on his way , suddenly two men in white garments stood beside them 11 and said : “ Men of Galʹi·lee , why do you stand looking into the sky ? This Jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will come in the same manner as you have seen him going into the sky . ”

27 Joʹtham was 25 years old when he became king , and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Je·ruʹshah the daughter of Zaʹdok . 2 He kept doing what was right in Jehovah ’ s eyes , just as his father Uz·ziʹah had done , except that he did not invade the temple of Jehovah . But the people were still acting ruinously . 3 He built the upper gate of Jehovah ’ s house , and he did much building on the wall of Oʹphel . 4 He also built cities in the mountainous region of Judah , and he built fortified places and towers in the wooded areas . 5 He waged war against the king of the Amʹmon·ites and eventually prevailed against them , so that the Amʹmon·ites gave him in that year 100 silver talents , 10 ,000 cor measures of wheat , and 10 ,000 of barley . The Amʹmon·ites also paid this to him in the second and third years . 6 So Joʹtham kept growing strong , for he established his ways before Jehovah his God .

Then he took in his hands the fire and the knife , and the two of them walked on together . 7 Then Isaac said to his father Abraham : “ My father ! ” He replied : “ Yes , my son ! ” So he continued : “ Here are the fire and the wood , but where is the sheep for the burnt offering ? ” 8 To this Abraham said : “ God himself will provide the sheep for the burnt offering , my son . ” And both of them walked on together .
14 Christian elders and parents find that commendation and encouragement are effective in emphasizing Bible counsel . When Paul commended the Corinthians for applying his counsel , they must have been encouraged to continue doing what was right . ( 2 Cor . 7 :8-11 ) Andreas , who has two children , says : “ Encouragement helps children to grow up spiritually and emotionally . You nail down counsel by giving encouragement . Even though our kids know what is right , doing the right thing becomes their way of life through our constant encouragement . ”
But we don 't see it on social media , right ?
11 People can receive God ’ s forgiveness only if they have already forgiven those who have sinned against them . ( Mark 11 :25 ) Stressing this point , Jesus added : “ For if you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you ; whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . ” ( Matt . 6 :14 , 15 ) Yes , God grants forgiveness only to those who freely forgive others . And one way to keep on doing good is to comply with Paul ’ s counsel : “ Even as Jehovah freely forgave you , so do you also . ” —Col . 3 :13 .

When a lovely bride appears before her handsome bridegroom on their wedding day , words can hardly describe their joy . God ’ s Word provides wise advice for all who choose to get married , for the loving Originator of marriage wants each couple to have a good measure of success and happiness in their married life . ( Prov . 18 :22 ) Yet , the Scriptures clearly tell us that imperfect humans who get married “ will have tribulation in their flesh . ” ( 1 Cor . 7 :28 ) How can such tribulation be kept to a minimum ? And what will make Christian marriage a success ? The Bible emphasizes the importance of love . Tender affection ( Greek , phi·liʹa ) is needed in a marriage . Romantic love ( eʹros ) brings delight , and love for family ( stor·geʹ ) is vital when children enter the picture . However , it is love based on principle ( a·gaʹpe ) that ensures the success of a marriage . w16 .08 2 :1 , 2

7 Jesus was an outstandingly diligent worker in carrying out his ministry . For three and a half years , he was intensely occupied with this all-important work . Wanting to reach as many people as possible , he used his days to the full , rising early and working on into the night . ( Luke 21 :37 , 38 ; John 3 :2 ) He journeyed “ from city to city and from village to village , preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God . ” ( Luke 8 :1 ) Jesus literally covered hundreds of miles , traveling on foot along dusty roads to take the message of the good news to people .
David might have concluded that Solomon was not qualified to oversee such an important project as building a house for God . After all , the temple was to be “ exceedingly magnificent , ” and Solomon was at the time “ young and inexperienced . ” Yet , David knew that Jehovah would equip Solomon to handle the work given to him . So David focused on what he could do to assist , preparing materials in great quantity . Likewise , older brothers today should not be disheartened when it becomes necessary to hand their assignments over to younger men . Rather , it is in the best interests of the work when younger ones are trained to handle responsibilities . Appointed men should have great satisfaction when the younger ones whom they have trained become qualified to take on the work . w17 .01 5 :8 , 9

Apply what you learn . Jesus told a story that illustrates this . A wise man built his house on rock . A foolish man built his house on sand . When a great storm came , the house built on rock did not cave in , but the house built on sand fell with a great crash . Jesus said that those who hear his teachings and do them are like the wise man who built on rock . But those who listen to his teachings and do not do them are like the foolish man who built on sand . Which man do you want to be like ? —Matthew 7 :24-27 .

So they continued banqueting and drinking with him to the full .
How do we know that the Father taught the Son how to teach ? Consider this : Jesus ’ abundant use of illustrations in his teaching fulfilled a prophecy that was recorded centuries before his birth . ( Ps . 78 :2 ; Matt . 13 :34 , 35 ) Clearly , the Author of that prophecy , Jehovah , determined well in advance that his Son would teach by means of illustrations , or parables .—2 Tim . 3 :16 , 17 .

9 What burdens do older ones bear ? Many tire easily . They may feel that doing even basic things—going to the doctor , doing paperwork , cleaning the house , preparing food—is beyond their capacity . Since appetite and thirst often diminish with age , they may think that they do not need to eat or drink as much as they really should . It can be similar with spiritual nourishment . Aging eyes and ears may make reading and listening to spiritual programs difficult , and just getting ready to go to Christian meetings may be exhausting .

13 In one of the Bible ’ s great restoration prophecies , the prophet Ezekiel was given a vision of a restored and glorified temple . From that temple flowed a stream of water , widening and deepening as it went until it became a “ double-size torrent . ” Wherever it flowed , that river brought blessings . On its banks flourished a crop of trees that provided food and healing . And the river even brought life and productivity to the salty , lifeless Dead Sea ! ( Ezekiel 47 :1-12 ) But what did all of that mean ?

2 “ The world ” Jesus mentioned refers to all of mankind who are alienated from God , ruled by Satan , and enslaved to the selfish , prideful spirit that emanates from him . ( John 14 :30 ; Ephesians 2 :2 ; 1 John 5 :19 ) Indeed , “ friendship with [ that ] world is enmity with God . ” ( James 4 :4 ) How , though , can all who want to remain in God ’ s love be in the world yet be separate from it ? We will consider five ways : by remaining loyal to God ’ s Kingdom under Christ and neutral in worldly politics , by resisting the spirit of the world , by being modest in our dress and grooming , by keeping our life simple , and by putting on our spiritual suit of armor .

10 Jehovah ’ s written Word acquaints us with the heavenly part of his organization . For example , the prophet Ezekiel received a vision in which the heavenly part of God ’ s organization is represented by a celestial chariot . ( Ezek . 1 :4-28 ) Jehovah rides on this chariot , and it goes wherever his spirit impels it to go . In turn , the heavenly part of his organization influences the earthly part . The chariot certainly has been on the move ! Think about the many organizational changes that have been made during the past decade—and bear in mind that Jehovah is behind such developments . With Christ and the holy angels about to destroy this wicked world , Jehovah ’ s chariot is rapidly moving toward the vindication of his sovereignty and the sanctification of his holy name !

( Eph . 1 :3 ) Do we individually imitate Paul in showing gratitude for Jehovah ’ s undeserved kindness by zealously sharing in the ministry ? —Read Romans 1 :14-16 .

Comment on thoughts that you found helpful . This can be beneficial to both of you . You might mention a point of interest from a recent issue of The Watchtower or Awake ! This should not be done as a show or a test of knowledge . Do it to share something in which you found special delight . You might talk about an assignment one of you may have in the Theocratic Ministry School and exchange ideas on how it could be handled . You might also share experiences from the field ministry .

15 Known for its witches , goblins , and other grotesque decorations and paraphernalia , Halloween—also called All Hallows ’ Eve or the eve of All Saints ’ Day—can be traced back to the ancient Celts of Britain and Ireland . On the full moon nearest November 1 , they celebrated the festival of Samhain , meaning “ Summer ’ s End . ” They believed that during Samhain , the veil between the human and the supernatural worlds was parted and that spirits , both good and evil , roamed the earth . The souls of the dead were thought to return to their homes , and families would put out food and drink for their ghostly visitors in hopes of appeasing them . Thus , when children today , dressed as ghosts or witches , go from house to house threatening a mischievous trick unless they receive a treat , they unwittingly perpetuate the rituals of Samhain .

12 Let us consider an illustration . Imagine that a teacher is telling his students how to solve a difficult problem . A clever but rebellious student claims that the teacher ’ s way of solving the problem is wrong . Implying that the teacher is not capable , this rebel insists that he knows a much better way to solve the problem . Some students think that he is right , and they also become rebellious . What should the teacher do ? If he throws the rebels out of the class , what will be the effect on the other students ? Will they not believe that their fellow student and those who joined him are right ? All the other students in the class might lose respect for the teacher , thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong . But suppose that the teacher allows the rebel to show the class how he would solve the problem .

His righteousness continues forever . ” 10 Now the One who abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the harvest of your righteousness . ) 11 In everything you are being enriched for every sort of generosity , which produces through us an expression of thanks to God ; 12 because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well for the needs of the holy ones but also to be rich in many expressions of thanks to God . 13 Through the proof that this relief ministry gives , they glorify God because you are submissive to the good news about the Christ , as you publicly declared , and because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all . 14 And with supplication for you , they express affection for you because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of God upon you .

5 As we noted in the preceding article , God examined Asa ’ s heart and judged it to be complete with Him . ( 1 Ki . 15 :14 ) In God ’ s eyes , Asa ’ s devotion was basically sound , satisfying divine requirements . Still , he had to reap the consequences of his unwise course . In dealing with Baasha , what led Asa to rely on humans—Ben-hadad and himself—instead of Jehovah ? Could he have thought that diplomacy or militaristic maneuvering would deliver a more favorable outcome than would turning to God for help ? Could he have given in to such reasoning as a result of receiving bad counsel ?
2 Jesus was not afraid . With complete confidence , he rebuked the wind and the sea : “ Hush ! Be quiet ! ” Immediately , the wind and the sea obeyed—the tempest ceased , the waves disappeared into stillness , and “ a great calm set in . ” An unusual fear now gripped the disciples . “ Who really is this ? ” they murmured to one another .

19 Jesus said : “ You must love your neighbor as yourself . ” It is normal to care about ourselves and to have a healthy measure of self-respect . If that were not so , the commandment would have little meaning . This proper love of self is not to be confused with the egocentric love of self mentioned by the apostle Paul at 2 Timothy 3 :2 . Rather , it is a reasonable sense of self-worth . One Bible scholar described it as “ a balanced self-love that is neither a narcissistic ‘ I am divine ’ nor a masochistic ‘ I am dirt . ’ ”

For example , the Sophists were a prominent group of Greek teachers in the fifth century B .C .E . They taught that standards of right and wrong were determined by popular opinion . Said one such teacher : “ Whatever things seem just and fine to each city , are just and fine for that city , so long as it thinks them so . ” By this measure , Jodie , mentioned in the preceding article , should keep the money , since the majority in his community , or “ city , ” would likely do that .

God created Jesus before creating Adam . In fact , God created Jesus and then used him to make everything else , including the angels . That is why the Bible calls Jesus “ the firstborn of all creation ” by God .—Read Colossians 1 :15 , 16 .
Nehemiah ’ s example demonstrates how modesty can help us to keep from becoming self-reliant when we receive a change of assignment or additional responsibility . Relying just on his own experience , an elder could begin to care for congregation matters without first approaching Jehovah in prayer . Others might make a decision first and then pray for Jehovah to bless their decision . Is that being modest , however ? A modest person will always remember his place before God and his role in God ’ s arrangement . Our abilities are not the important thing . Especially when we are faced with a familiar situation or problem , we have to be careful not to rely on ourselves . ( Prov . 3 :5 , 6 ) As members of God ’ s household , we learn to think in terms of fulfilling roles in a family or as part of a congregation rather than achieving a rank or climbing a corporate ladder .—1 Tim . 3 :15 . w17 .01 4 :7 , 8

( 1 Sam . 17 :32-51 ; Ps . 18 , superscription ) Because of God ’ s great loving-kindness , David was moved to write : “ Many things you yourself have done , O Jehovah my God , even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us ; there is none to be compared to you . ” —Ps . 40 :5 .

3 Now as he was traveling and getting near Damascus , suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him , 4 and he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him : “ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ” 5 He asked : “ Who are you , Lord ? ” He said : “ I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting . 6 But get up and go into the city , and you will be told what you must do . ” 7 Now the men who were traveling with him stood speechless , hearing , indeed , the sound of a voice but seeing no one . 8 Saul then got up from the ground , and though his eyes were open , he could see nothing . So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus . 9 And for three days he did not see anything , and he neither ate nor drank .

9 Jehovah gave Adam and Eve another command , which included a clear statement of the penalty if violated : “ As for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die . ” ( Gen . 2 :17 ) Was this command in any way unjust , unnecessary , or unreasonable ? Did it rob Adam and Eve of their freedom ? Certainly not . In fact , a number of Bible scholars comment on the logic and good sense of the command . For example , one scholar observes : “ The inference of God ’ s commands in [ Genesis 2 :16 , 17 ] is that only God knows what is good . . . for humanity and only God knows what is not good . . . for them . To enjoy the ‘ good , ’ humankind must trust God and obey him . If they disobey , they will be left to decide for themselves what is good . . . and what is not good . ” That is a burden that humans could not carry successfully on their own .

But as for the remaining matters , I will put them in order when I get there .

When a Bible student or a fellow believer asks what he should do in a given situation , how should you answer ? You may know what you would personally do . But each person must bear responsibility for his own decisions in life . ( Gal . 6 :5 ) The apostle Paul explained that he encouraged “ obedience by faith ” among the people to whom he preached . ( Rom . 16 :26 ) That is a fine example for us to follow . A person who makes decisions mainly to please his Bible teacher or another human is serving men , not living by faith . ( Gal . 1 :10 ) So a simple , direct answer may not be in the best interests of the one who is making the inquiry .

4 But Jehovah does more than simply take note of injustice . He also cares about those who have been victimized by it . When his people were cruelly treated by enemy nations , Jehovah was distressed “ over their groaning because of their oppressors and those who were shoving them around . ” ( Judges 2 :18 ) Perhaps you have observed that the more some people see injustice , the more they become calloused to it . Not so with Jehovah ! He has seen injustice in its entire scope for some 6 ,000 years , yet he has not wavered in his hatred for it . Rather , the Bible assures us that such things as “ a false tongue , ” “ hands that are shedding innocent blood , ” and “ a false witness that launches forth lies ” are detestable to him .—Proverbs 6 :16-19 .
We can think about how we 're going to test this intuition in our private life , in our business life , and most particularly when it goes to policy , when we think about things like No Child Left Behind , when you create new stock markets , when you create other policies -- taxation , health care and so on .

I have never seen such bad-looking cows in all the land of Egypt . 20 And the skinny , bad cows began to eat up the first seven fat cows . 21 But when they had consumed them , no one could have known that they had done so , since their appearance was just as bad as at the start . At that I woke up .

18 Obeying the new commandment to love one another is not an easy course to follow , but we have a powerful motivation for doing so . Paul wrote : “ The love the Christ has compels us , because this is what we have judged , that one man died for all . . . , and he died for all that those who live might live no longer for themselves , but for him who died for them and was raised up . ” ( 2 Corinthians 5 :14 , 15 ) Since Jesus died for us , should we not feel compelled to live for him ? We can do that by following his example of self-sacrificing love .

3 Jehovah is not oblivious to injustice . He sees what is going on . Regarding Noah ’ s day , the Bible tells us : “ Jehovah saw that the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time . ” ( Genesis 6 :5 ) Consider the implications of that statement . Often , our perception of injustice is based on a few incidents that we have either heard about or personally encountered . In contrast , Jehovah is aware of injustice on a global scale . He sees it all ! More than that , he can discern the inclinations of the heart—the debased thinking behind unjust acts .—Jeremiah 17 :10 .

3 Why did the once modest prophet presumptuously go along with that deceitful older man ? The Bible does not say . But it could be that he completely forgot that he was supposed to be ‘ walking modestly with God . ’ ( Read Micah 6 :8 . ) In the Bible , walking with Jehovah conveys the idea of trusting in him , supporting his sovereignty , and following his lead . A modest person is keenly aware that he can and must be in constant communication with his loving and almighty Father . The prophet could have asked Jehovah to clarify His instructions , but the Scriptures do not say that he did so . At times , we too have to make difficult decisions , and the right course to take may not be clear . Modestly seeking Jehovah ’ s guidance helps us to avoid making grave mistakes .

22 At once Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent , and there the garment was hidden in his tent , with the money underneath it . 23 So they took the things out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and placed them before Jehovah . 24 Joshua and all Israel with him then took Aʹchan the son of Zeʹrah , the silver , the official garment , and the bar of gold , along with his sons , his daughters , his bull , his donkey , his flock , his tent , and everything that was his , and they brought them up to the Valley of Aʹchor . 25 Joshua said : “ Why have you brought disaster upon us ? Jehovah will bring disaster upon you on this day . ” With that all Israel stoned him , after which they burned them with fire . Thus they stoned all of them . 26 And they raised a huge pile of stones over him that remains to this day . At this Jehovah ’ s hot anger subsided . That is why the name of that place is Valley of Aʹchor to this day .

4 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus , who is to judge the living and the dead , and by his manifestation and his Kingdom : 2 Preach the word ; be at it urgently in favorable times and difficult times ; reprove , reprimand , exhort , with all patience and art of teaching . 3 For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching , but according to their own desires , they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled . 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories . 5 You , though , keep your senses in all things , endure hardship , do the work of an evangelizer , fully accomplish your ministry .
But in the name of Jehovah ,
21 The sacred secret is an astonishing display of “ the greatly diversified wisdom of God . ” ( Ephesians 3 :8-10 ) What wisdom Jehovah displayed in formulating this secret , then in revealing it so gradually ! He wisely took into consideration the limitations of humans , allowing them to manifest their true heart condition .—Psalm 103 :14 .

This one is really moving for me because it 's the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning , and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending , she starts -- she said that she changed her mind , and now she loves that blue , she loves that star , and she loves that flag , talking about the Israeli flag , and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another , and just a few days after I posted the first poster .

24 “ So we went up to your slave my father and told him the words of my master . 25 Later our father said , ‘ Return and buy a little food for us . ’ 26 But we said , ‘ We are not able to go down . If our youngest brother is with us we will go down , for we can not see the man ’ s face unless our youngest brother is with us . ’ 27 Then your slave my father said to us , ‘ You well know that my wife bore but two sons to me . 28 But one of them left me and I said : “ He must surely have been torn to pieces ! ” and I have not seen him until now . 29 If you were to take this one also out of my sight and a fatal accident were to befall him , you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to the Grave with calamity . ’
41 And A·bimʹe·lech continued to dwell in A·ruʹmah , and Zeʹbul drove Gaʹal and his brothers out of Sheʹchem . 42 The next day the people went out into the field , and A·bimʹe·lech was told about it . 43 So he took the people and divided them into three bands and lay in wait in the field . When he saw the people going out of the city , he attacked them and struck them down . 44 A·bimʹe·lech and the bands with him charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city gate , while two bands attacked all who were in the field , and they struck them down . 45 A·bimʹe·lech fought against the city all that day and captured it . He killed the people in it , and then he pulled the city down and sowed it with salt .
The life of a person or an animal . Jehovah told Moses : “ All the men who were seeking to kill you [ “ seeking your soul , ” footnote ] are dead . ” ( Exodus 4 :19 ) When Jesus was on earth , he said : “ I am the fine shepherd ; the fine shepherd surrenders his life [ “ soul , ” footnote ] in behalf of the sheep . ” —John 10 :11 .

5 Ezʹra opened the book in the sight of all the people , for he was above all the people . As he opened it , all the people stood up . 6 Then Ezʹra praised Jehovah the true God , the great One , at which all the people answered , “ Amen ! Amen ! ” and lifted up their hands . They then bowed low and prostrated themselves to Jehovah with their faces to the ground . 7 And Jeshʹu·a , Baʹni , She·re·biʹah , Jaʹmin , Akʹkub , Shabʹbe·thai , Ho·diʹah , Ma·a·seiʹah , Ke·liʹta , Az·a·riʹah , Joʹza·bad , Haʹnan , and Pe·laʹiah , who were Levites , were explaining the Law to the people , while the people remained standing . 8 And they continued reading aloud from the book , from the Law of the true God , clearly explaining it and putting meaning into it ; so they helped the people to understand what was being read .
12 When , now , he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on , he again reclined at the table and said to them : “ Do you understand what I have done to you ? 13 You address me as ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and you are correct , for I am such . 14 Therefore , if I , the Lord and Teacher , washed your feet , you also should wash the feet of one another . 15 For I set the pattern for you , that just as I did to you , you should also do . 16 Most truly I say to you , a slave is not greater than his master , nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him . 17 If you know these things , happy you are if you do them . 18 I am not talking about all of you ; I know the ones I have chosen . But this was so that the scripture might be fulfilled : ‘ The one who was eating my bread has lifted his heel against me . ’ 19 From this moment on , I am telling you before it occurs , so that when it does occur you may believe that I am he . 20 Most truly I say to you , whoever receives anyone I send receives me also , and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me . ”

16 Would doing this work clearly make us an accomplice in or a promoter of a wrong practice ? Consider an example . Working as a receptionist is not wrong in itself . What , though , if a Christian were offered such a job at an abortion clinic ? Granted , his job assignment would not require him to help with the abortion procedures directly . Nevertheless , would not his regular work there support the operation of a clinic that exists to perform abortions—a practice that is contrary to God ’ s Word ? ( Exodus 21 :22-24 ) As lovers of Jehovah , we do not want to be closely linked with unscriptural practices .
When John Sempey heard that I was going to Northern Ireland , he asked me to call on his younger sister , Nellie , as she had shown some interest in Bible truth . My sister Connie and I conducted a Bible study with her . Nellie made rapid progress and dedicated her life to Jehovah . In time , we pursued a courtship and were married .

15 “ The merchants who sold these things , who became rich from her , will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and will weep and mourn , 16 saying : ‘ Too bad , too bad , the great city , clothed with fine linen , purple , and scarlet and richly adorned with gold ornaments , precious stones , and pearls , 17 because in one hour such great riches have been devastated ! ’
19 Place your full trust in Jehovah . ( Read Proverbs 3 :5 , 6 . ) Is he not worthy of such trust ? After all , he cares for us . ( 1 Peter 5 :7 ) He knows our needs better than we do , and his hand is never short . ( Psalm 37 :25 ) We therefore do well to listen when his Word reminds us : “ Let your way of life be free of the love of money , while you are content with the present things . For [ God ] has said : ‘ I will never leave you , and I will never abandon you . ’ ” ( Hebrews 13 :5 ) Many full-time servants can testify to God ’ s ability to provide life ’ s necessities . If we fully trust that Jehovah will care for us , we will avoid becoming unduly anxious about providing for our family . ( Matthew 6 :25-32 ) We will not allow secular work to cause us to neglect spiritual activities , such as preaching the good news and attending meetings .—Matthew 24 :14 ; Hebrews 10 :24 , 25 .

As Jehovah ’ s people , we have plenty to study . But where should we start ? Each day , we do well to study the text and comments from Examining the Scriptures Daily . Each week , we attend congregation meetings , and study done in preparation for these will help us to benefit to a greater extent . In addition to this , some have wisely invested time in studying some of our Christian publications that were printed prior to their learning the truth . Others select some portion of their weekly Bible reading and do deeper study of those verses .

23 Now after the copy of the official document of King Ar·ta·xerxʹes had been read before Reʹhum and Shimʹshai the scribe and their colleagues , they quickly went to Jerusalem to the Jews and used force to stop them . 24 It was then that the work on the house of God , which was in Jerusalem , came to a halt ; and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Da·riʹus of Persia .

11 David set a good example in pursuing peace . Twice he had the opportunity to kill Saul . On both occasions , he refrained from violence and later spoke respectfully to the king , hoping to restore peace . ( 1 Samuel 24 :8-11 ; 26 :17-20 ) What can be done today when a situation threatens to disturb the peace of the congregation ? We should “ seek to find peace , and pursue it . ” Thus , if we sense that relations between us and a fellow believer are strained , we obey Jesus ’ counsel : “ First make your peace with your brother . ” Then we continue with other aspects of true worship .—Matthew 5 :23 , 24 ; Ephesians 4 :26 .

3 Jehovah vividly describes for us the world situation as he sees it from his vantage point in the heavens . He gave the apostle John a vision in which Satan was depicted as “ a great fiery-colored dragon . ” He was poised to devour , if possible , God ’ s Messianic Kingdom as soon as it was brought to birth in heaven in 1914 . Failing in that , Satan unleashed a flood of vicious opposition against the earthly representatives of that Kingdom . ( Revelation 12 :3 , 4 , 13 , 17 ) How would Satan wage this warfare ? Through his own human representatives .

23 This case is significant in that the Supreme Court addressed the constitutional rights of mature minors . Before this ruling , a Canadian court could authorize medical treatment on a child under 16 as long as the court felt that the treatment was in the best interests of the child . But after this ruling , a court can not authorize any treatment against the will of young people under the age of 16 without first offering them the chance to prove that they are mature enough to make their own decisions .
7 After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job , Jehovah said to Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite :

5 Earlier on the same day that Jesus warned about the loss of love , he emphasized the most important love of all . He said : “ ‘ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ’ This is the greatest and first commandment . ” ( Matt . 22 :37 , 38 ) Indeed , having deep love for God helps us to obey Jehovah ’ s commandments , to endure , and to hate what is bad . ( Read Psalm 97 :10 . ) However , Satan and his world strive to undermine our love for God .

11 Then he said : “ A man had two sons . 12 And the younger one said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of the property that should come to me . ’ So he divided his belongings between them . 13 A few days later , the younger son gathered all his things together and traveled to a distant country and there squandered his property by living a debauched life . 14 When he had spent everything , a severe famine occurred throughout that country , and he fell into need . 15 He even went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to herd swine . 16 And he longed to be filled with the carob pods that the swine were eating , but no one would give him anything .

And in Section 4 , you saw that he has directly expressed his love for mankind—and for you personally—in remarkable ways . Now comes a question .

Prayer enables us to approach the study of God ’ s Word with the proper attitude . We want our heart , our inmost self , to be receptive to the instruction that Jehovah gives us . At the beginning of each study session , petition Jehovah for the help of his spirit . ( Luke 11 :13 ) Ask him to help you understand the meaning of what you will study , how it relates to his purpose , how it can help you to discern between good and bad , how you should apply his principles in your life , and how the material affects your relationship with him . ( Prov . 9 :10 ) As you study , “ keep on asking God ” for wisdom . ( Jas . 1 :5 ) Honestly evaluate yourself in the light of what you learn as you seek Jehovah ’ s help in getting rid of erroneous thoughts or hurtful desires . Always “ respond to Jehovah with thanksgiving ” for the things he reveals . ( Ps . 147 :7 ) This prayerful approach to study leads to intimacy with Jehovah , since it enables us to respond to him as he speaks to us through his Word .—Ps . 145 :18 .
He enlarges nations , that he may lead them into exile .
14 It is understandable that this spouse and others who face a similar situation in marriage feel hurt . Their mates ignore God ’ s basic instruction for marriage : “ A man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife . ” ( Genesis 2 :24 ) Of course , those who marry still respect their parents ; however , it is God ’ s arrangement that their foremost obligation is to their spouse . Similarly , Christians dearly love fellow believers ; yet their primary responsibility is to their spouse . Thus , when married Christians spend inappropriate amounts of time with or become overly familiar with fellow believers , especially those of the opposite sex , they put strains on the marriage bond . Could that be a reason for tension in your marriage ? Ask yourself , ‘ Do I truly give my spouse the time , attention , and affection that rightly belong to my mate ? ’
16 On the night before Jesus died , his disciples argued about who was greatest among them . Rather than become angry with them , Jesus lovingly continued to appeal to them by word and example . ( Luke 22 :24-27 ; John 13 :3-8 ) If you are a parent , can you see how you might follow Jesus ’ example in the way you correct your children ? True , they need discipline , but it should be given to “ the proper degree , ” never in anger . You would not use thoughtless speech , which is “ like the stabs of a sword . ” ( Jeremiah 30 :11 ; Proverbs 12 :18 ) Discipline should be delivered in such a way that your child will later see how appropriate it was .—Ephesians 6 :4 ; Hebrews 12 :9-11 .

( Matthew 6 :5-8 ; 1 Thessalonians 5 :17 ) We are happy when we obey his direction to meet together to worship him and encourage one another and when we have a full share in the preaching and teaching work . ( Matthew 28 :19 , 20 ; Galatians 6 :2 ; Hebrews 10 :24 , 25 ) As we think about how these things have helped us to keep our faith strong , we become more and more convinced that Jehovah ’ s ways are best .

8 God ’ s Kingdom is a stable , enduring government . Its enduring quality is ensured by the fact that Jehovah himself is not subject to death . ( Habakkuk 1 :12 ) In contrast with human kings , Jesus Christ , the one to whom God has entrusted kingship , is also immortal . ( Romans 6 :9 ; 1 Timothy 6 :15 , 16 ) Associated with Christ on heavenly thrones will be 144 ,000 others , loyal servants of God out of “ every tribe and tongue and people and nation . ” These too are given immortal life . ( Revelation 5 :9 , 10 ; 14 :1-4 ; 1 Corinthians 15 :42-44 , 53 ) The vast majority of them are already in the heavens , and the remnant of them yet on earth make up the present-day “ faithful and discreet slave , ” which loyally furthers the interests of that Kingdom here .—Matthew 24 :45-47 .

In his great prophecy about his presence and the end of this system of things , he likened those events to the time of Noah . ( Matthew 24 :37-39 ) The apostle Peter also wrote about the floodwaters in Noah ’ s day : “ By those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water . ” —2 Peter 3 :6 .
So that they strayed so far from me ,
The apostle Paul called our Maker “ the God of love and of peace . ” ( 2 Corinthians 13 :11 ) Why ? Jesus Christ earlier said : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son , in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ” ( John 3 :16 ) Out of his deep love for mankind , God gave his beloved Son as a ransom , making it possible for those who exercise faith in him to enjoy life without end , free from the pain and suffering that resulted from sin . That is why Paul also said : “ The wages sin pays is death , but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord . ” ( Romans 6 :23 ) Should that not move us to love God and draw close to him ?

39 And yet all of these , although they received a favorable witness because of their faith , did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise , 40 because God had foreseen something better for us , so that they might not be made perfect apart from us .
Some have chosen study projects that involved studying Bible prophecy or the Bible ’ s historical , archaeological , and scientific accuracy . One fascinating prophecy to consider is Genesis 3 :15 . That verse introduces the Bible ’ s primary theme , which is the vindication of God ’ s sovereignty and the sanctification of his name by means of the Kingdom . That one verse , using figurative language , sets out how Jehovah will solve all the suffering that humans have experienced since Eden . How might you study Genesis 3 :15 ? One way would be to prepare a time line . It could list key scriptures that show how God bit by bit shed light on the individuals and arrangement referred to in this verse and that prove that the prophecy will be fulfilled . As you see the scriptures form a harmonious unit , you will surely conclude that the Bible prophets and writers must have been “ moved by holy spirit . ” w16 .09 4 :8

As “ a preacher of righteousness , ” Noah faithfully proclaimed the warning message he had been given . No doubt , doing so helped Noah keep his faith strong . In addition to preaching , he also used his physical and mental abilities to accomplish the God-assigned work of building an ark . ( Heb . 11 :7 ) Like Noah , we strive to have “ plenty to do in the work of the Lord . ” ( 1 Cor . 15 :58 ) Such work may include the construction and maintenance of facilities for worship , volunteering to assist at assemblies and conventions , or caring for assignments at a branch office or a remote translation office . Above all , we stay busy in the preaching work , knowing that this work strengthens our hope for the future . Indeed , sharing in the preaching work fortifies our resolve not to give up in the race for life .—1 Cor . 9 :24 . w17 .01 1 :8 , 9

7 After this Jesus continued traveling about in Galʹi·lee , for he did not want to do so in Ju·deʹa because the Jews were seeking to kill him . 2 However , the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near . 3 So his brothers said to him : “ Leave here and go into Ju·deʹa , so that your disciples may also see the works you are doing . 4 For no one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly . If you are doing these things , show yourself to the world . ” 5 His brothers were , in fact , not exercising faith in him . 6 So Jesus said to them : “ My time has not yet arrived , but your time is always at hand . 7 The world has no reason to hate you , but it hates me , because I bear witness about it that its works are wicked . 8 You go up to the festival ; I am not yet going up to this festival , because my time has not yet fully come . ” 9 So after he told them these things , he remained in Galʹi·lee .

God is disgusted with false religion . In fact , God ’ s Word , the Bible , holds false religion responsible for “ the blood . . . of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth . ” ( Revelation 18 :24 ) Because false religion has failed to teach people about the true God , whose very essence is love , those religions are bloodguilty in God ’ s eyes .—1 John 4 :8 .

26 After the scourge , Jehovah said to Moses and El·e·aʹzar the son of Aaron the priest : 2 “ Take a census of the whole assembly of the Israelites from 20 years of age and up , by their paternal houses , counting all those who can serve in the army in Israel . ” 3 So Moses and El·e·aʹzar the priest spoke with them in the desert plains of Moʹab by the Jordan at Jerʹi·cho , saying : 4 “ Take a census of them from the age of 20 years and up , just as Jehovah commanded Moses . ”
The apostle Paul explained that Jesus had cleansed the Christian congregation “ with the bath of water by means of the word . ” Like water , which cleanses physically , the truth of God ’ s Word has power to carry out moral and spiritual cleansing . This cleansing leaves Christ ’ s disciples “ holy and without blemish . ” ( Ephesians 5 :25-27 ) Thus , all who desire God ’ s favor must work to keep themselves morally and spiritually “ spotless and unblemished . ” ( 2 Peter 3 :11 , 14 ) How does God ’ s Word help them to do this ?

13 Therefore , let us not judge one another any longer but , rather , be determined not to put a stumbling block or an obstacle before a brother . 14 I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself ; only where a man considers something to be unclean , to him it is unclean . 15 For if your brother is being offended because of food , you are no longer walking according to love . Do not by your food ruin that one for whom Christ died . 16 Therefore , do not let the good you do be spoken of as bad . 17 For the Kingdom of God does not mean eating and drinking , but means righteousness and peace and joy with holy spirit . 18 For whoever slaves for Christ in this way is acceptable to God and has approval with men .

33 When they heard this , they were infuriated and wanted to do away with them . 34 But a Pharisee named Ga·maʹli·el rose in the Sanʹhe·drin ; he was a Law teacher esteemed by all the people , and he gave the command to put the men outside for a little while . 35 Then he said to them : “ Men of Israel , be careful as to what you intend to do about these men . 36 For instance , before these days Theuʹdas rose up , saying he himself was somebody , and a number of men , about 400 , joined his party . But he was done away with , and all those who were following him were dispersed and came to nothing . 37 After him , Judas the Gal·i·leʹan rose up in the days of the registration , and he drew followers after himself . That man also perished , and all those who were following him were scattered . 38 So under the present circumstances , I say to you , do not meddle with these men , but let them alone . For if this scheme or this work is from men , it will be overthrown ; 39 but if it is from God , you will not be able to overthrow them . Otherwise , you may even be found fighters against God himself . ” 40 At this they took his advice , and they summoned the apostles , flogged them , and ordered them to stop speaking on the basis of Jesus ’ name , and let them go .
During his famous Sermon on the Mount , Jesus used an expression that is often translated “ Blessed are the poor in spirit . ” ( Matthew 5 :3 , King James Version ) But in many languages , a literal rendering of this expression is obscure . In some cases , a strictly literal translation could imply that “ the poor in spirit ” are mentally unbalanced or lacking in vitality and determination . However , Jesus was here teaching people that their happiness depended , not on satisfying their physical needs , but on recognizing their need for God ’ s guidance . ( Luke 6 :20 ) Thus , such renderings as “ those conscious of their spiritual need ” or “ those who know their need for God ” convey more accurately the meaning of the original expression .—Matthew 5 :3 ; The New Testament in Modern English .
But there is more to Jesus ’ use of illustrations . It serves to reveal the attitude of people . Many of them are interested in Jesus simply as a masterful storyteller and miracle worker . They do not see him as someone to be obeyed as Lord and to be unselfishly followed . ( Luke 6 :46 , 47 ) They do not want to be disturbed in their view of things or their way of life . No , they do not want the message to penetrate that deeply .

10 A young person who focuses his life on the desire to please Jehovah gives special attention to the ministry . Jesus Christ stressed that “ the good news has to be preached first . ” ( Mark 13 :10 ) Because the preaching work is so urgent , it should be high on our list of priorities . Could you set the goal of sharing in the ministry more often ? Could you pioneer ? But what if you find little joy in preaching ? And how can you be more effective at giving a witness ? Two basic steps will help : Prepare well , and do not give up sharing what you know with others . It might surprise you how much joy you will then find when preaching .

By calling Jesus “ Son of David , ” these men express their belief that Jesus is heir to the throne of David and thus the Messiah . Jesus seems to ignore their cries , perhaps to see whether they will be persistent , and they are . When Jesus enters a house , the two men follow him inside . Jesus asks them : “ Do you have faith that I can do this ? ” They answer confidently : “ Yes , Lord . ” At that , Jesus touches their eyes and says : “ According to your faith let it happen to you . ” —Matthew 9 :28 , 29 .

15 The south side was from the extremity of Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim , and the boundary extended westward ; it went out to the spring of the waters of Neph·toʹah . 16 The boundary went down to the extremity of the mountain that faces the Valley of the Son of Hinʹnom , which is in the Valley of Rephʹa·im to the north , and it went down to the Valley of Hinʹnom , to the slope of the Jebʹu·site on the south , and down to En-roʹgel . 17 And it was marked northward and extended to En-sheʹmesh and then out to Gel·iʹloth , which is in front of the ascent of A·dumʹmim , and it went down to the stone of Boʹhan the son of Reuʹben . 18 And it continued to the northern slope in front of the Arʹa·bah and went down to the Arʹa·bah . 19 And the boundary continued to the northern slope of Beth-hogʹlah , and the boundary ended at the northern bay of the Salt Sea at the southern end of the Jordan . This was the southern boundary . 20 And the Jordan served as its boundary on the eastern side . This was the inheritance of the descendants of Benjamin by their families , according to its boundaries on all sides .
4 After leading the Israelites out of Egypt , Jehovah told them to build a portable tent , or tabernacle , for worship . The structure and its furnishings would require considerable resources . Jehovah instructed Moses to give the people the opportunity to support the project , saying : “ Let everyone with a willing heart bring a contribution for Jehovah . ” ( Ex . 35 :5 ) How did the people , who not long before had toiled “ in harsh conditions in every form of slavery , ” respond ? ( Ex . 1 :14 ) They showed unqualified support , willingly parting with gold , silver , and other valuables—most of which they had likely obtained from their former masters , the Egyptians . ( Ex . 12 :35 , 36 ) The Israelites gave more than was needed and had to be “ restrained from bringing in anything else . ” —Ex . 36 :4-7 .

For those who believe that the Bible is God ’ s Word , though , a global flood is more than a possibility . It is a fact .

13 There was great diversity in Jesus ’ miracles . He had authority over demons , expelling them with ease . ( Luke 9 :37-43 ) He had power over physical elements , turning water into wine . ( John 2 :1-11 ) To the amazement of his disciples , he walked on the windswept Sea of Galilee . ( John 6 :18 , 19 ) He had mastery over disease , curing organic defects , chronic illness , and life-threatening sickness . ( Mark 3 :1-5 ; John 4 :46-54 ) He performed such healings in various ways . Some were healed from a distance , whereas others felt Jesus ’ personal touch . ( Matthew 8 :2 , 3 , 5-13 ) Some were healed instantly , others gradually .—Mark 8 :22-25 ; Luke 8 :43 , 44 .

4 Then Jehovah hurled a strong wind at the sea , and there was such a violent storm on the sea that the ship was about to be wrecked . 5 The mariners were so frightened that each of them began to call on his god for help .

But Joʹnah had gone down into the inner part of the ship , where he lay down and fell fast asleep . 6 The ship captain approached and said to him : “ Why are you sleeping ?

Hence , the Pharisees call the man back and intimidate him by claiming that they have evidence against Jesus . “ Give glory to God , ” they demand . “ We know that this man is a sinner . ” Deflecting their charge , the man who was blind says : “ Whether he is a sinner , I do not know . ” Yet he states : “ One thing I do know , that I was blind , but now I can see . ” —John 9 :24 , 25 .
17 The apostle Peter wrote : “ Maintain a good conscience . ” ( 1 Peter 3 :16 ) A conscience that is clean in the sight of Jehovah God is a tremendous blessing . It is not like the consciences of so many today . Paul described those “ whose conscience is seared as with a branding iron . ” ( 1 Timothy 4 :2 ) A branding iron sears the flesh , leaving it scarred and insensitive . Many have a conscience that is , in effect , dead—so scarred and insensitive that it no longer sends out warnings , protests , or pangs of shame or guilt over wrongdoing . “ Good riddance , ” many today seem to say to such feelings as guilt .

Your land will be apportioned out with a measuring line , and you yourself will die in an unclean land ; and Israel will surely go into exile from its land . ” ’ ”

I brought them to the dining room of the sons of Haʹnan the son of Ig·da·liʹah , a man of the true God , which was next to the dining room of the princes that was above the dining room of Ma·a·seiʹah the son of Shalʹlum the doorkeeper . 5 Then I put cups and goblets full of wine before the men of the house of the Reʹcha·bites and said to them : “ Drink wine . ”

25 Let us rejoin him in that tense moment of addressing Israel at Gilgal . There , elderly Samuel reminded Israel of his faithful record of integrity . Then , we read : “ Samuel called to Jehovah . ” He asked Jehovah for a thunderstorm .—1 Sam . 12 :17 , 18 .
14 Then they called out to Jehovah and said : “ Ah , now , O Jehovah , please , may we not perish because of this man ! Do not hold us responsible for innocent blood , since you have done as you pleased , O Jehovah . ” 15 Then they lifted Joʹnah up and threw him into the sea ; and the sea ceased its raging . 16 Then the men were struck with great fear of Jehovah , and they offered a sacrifice to Jehovah and made vows .

21 Do you not know ?
5 Many of those who listened to Jesus were from the disadvantaged , lowly class of Jews . Thus , Jesus “ felt pity for them , because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd . ” ( Matthew 9 :36 ) Would such lowly ones have the courage to follow Jesus ? To do so , they would need to cultivate the fear of Jehovah , not of men . Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . But I will indicate to you whom to fear : Fear him who after killing has authority to throw into Gehenna . Yes , I tell you , fear this One . Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value , do they not ? Yet not one of them goes forgotten before God . But even the hairs of your heads are all numbered . Have no fear ; you are worth more than many sparrows . ” —Luke 12 :4-7 .

And Jehovah struck the child whom U·riʹah ’ s wife had borne to David , and he became sick . 16 David pleaded with the true God in behalf of the boy . David went on a strict fast and would go in and spend the night lying on the ground . 17 So the elders of his house stood over him and tried to raise him up from the ground , but he refused and would not eat with them . 18 On the seventh day the child died , but David ’ s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead . They said : “ While the child was alive we spoke to him , and he did not listen to us . So how can we tell him that the child has died ? He may do something terrible . ”

From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give me as a reward in that day , yet not only to me , but also to all those who have loved his manifestation . ” —2 Tim . 4 :7 , 8 .

You will not be successful ! Because you have abandoned Jehovah , he will , in turn , abandon you . ’ ” 21 But they conspired against him and stoned him at the king ’ s order in the courtyard of Jehovah ’ s house . 22 Thus King Je·hoʹash did not remember the loyal love that his father Je·hoiʹa·da had shown toward him , and he killed his son , who said as he was dying : “ May Jehovah see to it and call you to account . ”

Hy·me·naeʹus and Phi·leʹtus are among them . 18 These men have deviated from the truth , saying that the resurrection has already occurred , and they are subverting the faith of some . 19 Despite that , the solid foundation of God remains standing , having this seal , “ Jehovah knows those who belong to him , ” and , “ Let everyone calling on the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness . ”

5 Encouragement often involves commending a person for something he or she did well . We can also be encouraging by reassuring others that they have good qualities or by speaking “ consolingly to those who are discouraged . ” ( 1 Thess . 5 :14 , ftn . ) The Greek word usually translated “ encouragement ” literally means “ a calling to one ’ s side . ” As we serve alongside our brothers and sisters , we likely have opportunities to say something encouraging . ( Read Ecclesiastes 4 :9 , 10 . ) Do we use suitable occasions to let others know why we love and appreciate them ? Before answering that question , we would do well to think about this proverb : “ A word spoken at the right time—how good it is ! ” —Prov . 15 :23 .

17 For example , imagine this situation . At a sister ’ s place of work , a man begins to give her special attention and invites her to go out on a date . He doesn ’ t serve Jehovah , but he seems very nice and kind . Another sister sees them together and later tries to warn her about it . How will the first sister react ? Will she defend herself , or will she see the wisdom in the warning ? The sister may love Jehovah and want to do what is right . But if she keeps going out with this man , is she ‘ fleeing from sexual immorality ’ or is she ‘ trusting in her own heart ’ ? —Proverbs 22 :3 ; 28 :26 ; Matthew 6 :13 ; 26 :41 .
15 He says to them , But who do you say that I am ?
12 Matters relating to Jehovah God should be given first importance in our prayers . We certainly have reason to express heartfelt praise and thanks to him for all his goodness . ( 1 Chronicles 29 :10-13 ) Jesus gave the model prayer , recorded at Matthew 6 :9-13 , in which he taught us to pray that God ’ s name be sanctified , that is , treated as sacred , or holy . ( Read . ) That God ’ s Kingdom come and that his will be done on earth as it is in heaven are mentioned next . Only after covering these important matters relating to Jehovah did Jesus give attention to personal concerns . When we likewise give God the most important place in our prayers , we show that we are interested in more than just our own welfare .
On January 23 , 1962 , just after the convention , missionary Andrew D ’ Amico and I were arrested at the branch office , and the stock of Awake ! of January 8 , 1962 ( in French ) , was confiscated . Awake ! had quoted French newspapers that reported that voodoo was practiced in Haiti . Some did not like that statement and claimed that we had written the article at the branch . A few weeks later , the missionaries were deported . But the trained local brothers carried on magnificently . Today , I rejoice with them over the endurance they showed and the spiritual progress they made . They now even have the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Haitian Creole—something we could only have dreamed of back then .

This training will serve you well in your ministry . As you engage in the field service , you have many opportunities to read to others . Since God ’ s Word has the power to change people ’ s lives , it is important that you read it well . ( Heb . 4 :12 ) Do not expect to master all aspects of effective reading with one or two assignments . To a Christian elder who had years of experience , the apostle Paul wrote : “ Continue applying yourself to public reading . ” —1 Tim . 4 :13 .
7 At that the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said : “ Take note , please , and see that this man is bent on bringing calamity , for he demanded my wives , my sons , my silver , and my gold , and I did not refuse him . ” 8 Then all the elders and all the people said to him : “ Do not obey , and do not consent . ” 9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-haʹdad : “ Say to my lord the king , ‘ All that you first demanded of your servant I will do , but this I can not do . ’ ” With that the messengers went off and brought word back to him .

Hence , even though Revelation 20 :1-3 speaks only of Satan ’ s being seized and hurled into the abyss of inactivity , we can logically conclude that his angels too will be bound and abyssed . Neither Satan nor his demon hordes will be allowed to interfere with the fulfillment of God ’ s purpose to transform the earth into a paradise and restore mankind to perfection during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ .

9 Children who are lovingly disciplined usually feel secure . They learn that freedom has boundaries and that decisions and conduct have consequences—good or bad . How important , then , that Christian parents look to Jehovah for guidance . Do not forget that ideas and methods vary from culture to culture and from generation to generation . When parents listen to God , successful child-rearing does not become a matter of guesswork ; nor does it depend on human experience or human thinking .
But in my heart it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones ,

14 We can also maintain integrity by avoiding a fault-finding , critical spirit . That means , of course , being loyal to Jehovah . He is blessing his people now more than ever . Pure worship has never in all of history been so exalted on earth . ( Isa . 2 :2-4 ) When adjustments are made in explanation of Bible texts or in how things are done , we want to accept them . We are delighted to see evidence that the spiritual light is still increasing . ( Prov . 4 :18 ) If we find it hard to understand a change , we ask Jehovah to help us to comprehend the point . Meanwhile , we endure in an obedient course , keeping our integrity .

When speaking , use short sentences . Express complete thoughts before pausing for the interpreter . ( He renders thoughts , not necessarily all the words . ) For consecutive interpretation , allow the interpreter to finish before you continue .
Of course , the ability to read well is not a virtue in itself . The skill needs to be used in the proper way . Like eating , reading must be done selectively . Why eat food that offers no real nourishment or that may even poison you ? In like manner , why read material , even casually , that can corrupt the mind and heart ? Bible principles should provide the standard against which we measure whatever reading material we choose . Before deciding what you will read , have in mind such scriptures as Ecclesiastes 12 :12 , 13 ; Ephesians 4 :22-24 ; 5 :3 , 4 ; Philippians 4 :8 ; Colossians 2 :8 ; 1 John 2 :15-17 ; and 2 John 10 .

They are unclean for you . 8 Also the pig because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud . It is unclean for you . You must not eat their flesh or touch their carcasses .

To accomplish those tasks , the only-begotten Son had at his disposal the most powerful force in the universe—God ’ s holy spirit . This Son found great pleasure in being the Master Worker , whom Jehovah used in creating all other things .—Proverbs 8 :22-31 .

Today , millions of sincere and informed Christians know that Jesus is no legendary figure . They accept him as the enthroned King of God ’ s established Kingdom in heaven , who is about to take full control of the earth and its affairs . This divine government is welcome news because it promises relief from world problems . True Christians manifest their loyal support of Jehovah ’ s chosen King by declaring “ this good news of the kingdom ” to others .—Matthew 24 :14 .

18 If we get rid of everything in our life that has to do with demonism and rely on Jehovah to protect us , we can resist Satan and the demons . We do not need to be afraid of them .

( Jude 6 ) Remember , we are not alone in our fight . Jehovah is using his angels to protect us . ( 2 Kings 6 :15-17 ) We can be confident that with Jehovah ’ s help , we can win our fight against Satan and the demons .—1 Peter 5 :6 , 7 ; 2 Peter 2 :9 .

11 After Jesus pronounces his judgment on “ all the nations , ” several significant events are still to occur before the war of Armageddon begins . ( Matt . 25 :32 ) We will consider two of those events : the attack of Gog and the gathering of anointed ones . As we examine those two events , we need to keep in mind that God ’ s Word does not reveal the exact timing of these events . In fact , it seems likely that one will overlap the other to some extent .
An abortion is done intentionally to cause the death of an unborn child . It is not an accident or the result of a natural reaction of the human body . From the time of conception , a child is not just another part of the mother ’ s body . The child is a separate person .

In addition to reviewing what you have read and telling others about it , you will find that meditating on important things that have been learned is beneficial . The Bible writers Asaph and David did that . Asaph said : “ I shall remember the practices of Jah ; for I will remember your marvelous doing of long ago . And I shall certainly meditate on all your activity , and with your dealings I will concern myself . ” ( Ps . 77 :11 , 12 ) David similarly wrote : “ During the night watches I meditate on you , ” and “ I have remembered days of long ago ; I have meditated on all your activity . ” ( Ps . 63 :6 ; 143 :5 ) Do you do that ?

10 But David ’ s heart was struck with remorse after he had numbered the people . David then said to Jehovah : “ I have sinned greatly by doing this . And now , Jehovah , please forgive your servant ’ s error , for I have acted very foolishly . ” 11 When David got up in the morning , Jehovah ’ s word came to Gad the prophet , David ’ s visionary , saying : 12 “ Go and say to David , ‘ This is what Jehovah says : “ I am giving you three options . Choose the one that I should bring on you . ” ’ ” 13 So Gad came in to David and told him : “ Should seven years of famine come on your land ? Or should you flee for three months from your adversaries while they pursue you ? Or should there be three days of pestilence in your land ? Now consider carefully what I should reply to the One who sent me . ” 14 So David said to Gad : “ It is very distressing to me . Let us fall , please , into the hand of Jehovah , for his mercy is great ; but do not let me fall into the hand of man . ”

2 The four Judean kings who were considered in the preceding article served Jehovah with a complete heart . Still , they made some serious mistakes . What can we learn from their experiences , and how can we avoid a similar course ? Meditating on these examples can help us to benefit from the things that were written beforehand for our instruction .—Read Romans 15 :4 .

10 We need to imitate God , who freely forgives repentant sinners . The apostle Paul wrote : “ Become kind to one another , tenderly compassionate , freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you . ” ( Eph . 4 :32 ) The psalmist David sang : “ Jehovah is merciful and gracious , slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness . . . . He has not done to us even according to our sins ; nor according to our errors has he brought upon us what we deserve . . . . As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset , so far off from us he has put our transgressions . As a father shows mercy to his sons , Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him . For he himself well knows the formation of us , remembering that we are dust . ” —Ps . 103 :8-14 .

3 Jehovah first disclosed the intimate connection between life and blood , as well as their sanctity , or sacredness , shortly after Cain murdered Abel . “ Listen ! ” God said to Cain . “ Your brother ’ s blood is crying out to me from the ground . ” ( Genesis 4 :10 ) In Jehovah ’ s eyes , Abel ’ s blood represented his life , which had been brutally cut short . So , in a sense , Abel ’ s blood cried out to God for vengeance .—Hebrews 12 :24 .

18 He now brought the ram of the burnt offering near , and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram . 19 Moses then slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar . 20 He cut the ram into its pieces , and Moses made the head , the pieces , and the suet smoke . 21 He washed the intestines and the shanks with water , and Moses made the entire ram smoke on the altar . It was a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma . It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah , just as Jehovah had commanded Moses .

4 Paul was honestly acknowledging that on his own , he was incapable of doing God ’ s will to the extent that he himself desired . The reason ? “ All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God , ” he said . ( Rom . 3 :23 ) As a descendant of Adam , Paul was subject to the effects of sin on the imperfect flesh . We can relate to him because all of us are imperfect and have to face similar struggles every day . Moreover , there are many distractions that could divert our attention and take us off ‘ the cramped road leading into life . ’ ( Matt . 7 :14 ) However , the situation was not hopeless for Paul , and it is not for us .

13 There is a force in the lives of anointed Christians and their companions that they by all means hold sacred—holy spirit . That spirit is Jehovah ’ s active force , and since it always acts in harmony with the will of the holy God , it is properly called “ holy spirit , ” or “ the spirit of holiness . ” ( John 14 :26 ; Romans 1 :4 ) By means of holy spirit , Jehovah provides his servants the power to preach the good news . ( Acts 1 :8 ; 4 :31 ) Jehovah gives his spirit to “ those obeying him as ruler , ” to those who “ keep walking by spirit , ” not according to fleshly desires . ( Acts 5 :32 ; Galatians 5 :16 , 25 ; Romans 8 :5-8 ) This powerful force enables Christians to produce “ the fruitage of the spirit ” —fine qualities—and “ holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion . ” ( Galatians 5 :22 , 23 ; 2 Peter 3 :11 ) If the holy spirit is something sacred to us , we will avoid doing anything that might grieve that spirit , or obstruct its action in our lives .—Ephesians 4 :30 .
“ THE little one will become a thousand and the small one a mighty nation . I myself , Jehovah , will speed it up in its own time . ” ( Isa . 60 :22 ) How has that prophecy come true ? How has its fulfillment affected longtime Witnesses around the world ?
6 “ Jehovah our God told us in Hoʹreb , ‘ You have stayed long enough in this mountainous region . 7 Turn and set out for the mountainous region of the Amʹor·ites and toward all their neighbors in the Arʹa·bah , the mountainous region , the She·pheʹlah , the Negʹeb , and the seacoast , the land of the Caʹnaan·ites , and Lebʹa·non , up to the great river , the river Eu·phraʹtes . 8 See , I have set the land before you .

Consult ( Pr 15 :22 ) : Service overseers should consult together and work out a mutually acceptable system for spreading the good news . If their territory is limited , congregations that preach in other languages will likely want you to skip homes that are in their territory . However , if they are unable to cover all their territory regularly because it is scattered over a large area , they may prefer that you not skip any homes but inform them when someone in their territory shows interest . ( od 93 ¶37 ) Or they may ask that your congregation help them to find people who speak the language of their congregation and whose addresses can be transferred to their territory . ( km 7/12 5 , box ) Keep in mind that in some instances , more than one language may be spoken in the same home . Arrangements for covering the territory should comply with applicable data protection laws .

30 Hez·e·kiʹah sent word to all Israel and Judah , and even wrote letters to Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh , to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem to observe the Passover to Jehovah the God of Israel . 2 However , the king , his princes , and the whole congregation in Jerusalem decided to observe the Passover in the second month , 3 for they had not been able to observe it at the regular time , because not enough priests had sanctified themselves nor had the people gathered in Jerusalem . 4 This arrangement seemed right in the eyes of the king and the entire congregation . 5 So they decided to make an announcement throughout Israel , from Beʹer-sheʹba to Dan , that the people should come and observe the Passover to Jehovah the God of Israel at Jerusalem , for as a group they had not observed it according to what is written .

Italy is located in Southern Europe , between latitudes 35° and 47° N , and longitudes 6° and 19° E . To the north , Italy borders France , Switzerland , Austria and Slovenia , and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed , enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain . To the south , it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia , in addition to many smaller islands . The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy , while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland .
God ’ s interest was reflected in the Mosaic Law . ( Exodus 23 :4 , 5 , 12 ; Deuteronomy 22 :10 ; 25 :4 ) In harmony with that Law , Proverbs 12 :10 states : “ The righteous one takes care of his domestic animals , but even the mercy of the wicked is cruel . ” Soon both the wicked and their ways will be things of the past .

6 Love is related to another quality that can help us to avoid misusing power : godly fear . What is the value of this quality ? “ In the fear of Jehovah one turns away from bad , ” says Proverbs 16 :6 . The misuse of power is certainly among the bad ways from which we should turn away . Fear of God will restrain us from mistreating those over whom we have power . Why ? For one thing , we know that we are accountable to God for the way we treat such ones . ( Nehemiah 5 :1-7 , 15 ) But godly fear involves more than that . The original-language terms used for “ fear ” often refer to a profound reverence and awe of God . The Bible thus associates fear with love for God . ( Deuteronomy 10 :12 , 13 ) This reverential awe includes a healthy fear of displeasing God—not simply because we fear the consequences but because we truly love him .

4 For example , Volume VI of the Millennial Dawn series , which was published in 1904 , encouraged Christians to avoid participation in war . However , it reasoned that if a Christian was conscripted , he should strive to obtain some form of noncombatant service . If that failed and he was sent into combat , he should ensure that he did not commit murder . Commenting on the situation at that time , Herbert Senior , who lived in Britain and was baptized in 1905 , said : “ There was a lot of confusion among the brothers and no clear advice as to whether it would be right to join the army as a soldier but only for noncombatant work . ”

He also measured the outer sanctuary , the inner sanctuary , and the porches of the courtyard , 16 as well as the thresholds , the windows with narrowing frames , and the galleries that were in those three areas . Near the threshold were wood panels from the floor up to the windows ; and the windows were covered . 17 Measurements were taken above the entrance and in the inner temple and on the outside and on the entire wall all around . 18 It had carved cherubs and palm-tree figures , with each palm tree between two cherubs , and each cherub had two faces . 19 The human face was toward the palm tree on one side , and the face of a lion was toward the palm tree on the other side . They were carved this way throughout the entire temple . 20 From the floor to the area above the entrance were carved cherubs and palm-tree figures on the wall of the sanctuary .

21 Jesus Christ unquestionably proved to be the foretold “ Wonderful Counselor . ” ( Isa . 9 :6 ) The Sermon on the Mount is a prime example of Jesus ’ knowledge of his heavenly Father ’ s way of viewing things . In addition to the points we have discussed , that discourse has much to say about genuine happiness , how to avoid immorality , the way to practice righteousness , what we must do to enjoy a secure and joyous future , and many other matters . Why not read Matthew chapters 5 through 7 once again carefully and prayerfully ? Meditate on Jesus ’ wonderful counsel recorded there . Apply in your life what Christ said in his Sermon on the Mount . Then you will be better able to please Jehovah , treat others properly , and keep on doing good .
11 They marched from there against the inhabitants of Deʹbir .

So he gave him his daughter Achʹsah as a wife . 14 While she was going home , she urged him to ask her father for a field . Then she dismounted from her donkey . Caʹleb asked her : “ What do you want ? ” 15 She said to him : “ Please grant me a blessing , for you have given me a piece of land in the south ; give me also Gulʹloth-maʹim . ” So Caʹleb gave her Upper Gulʹloth and Lower Gulʹloth .

15 Jehovah ’ s wisdom is evident in his works throughout the universe . The starry heavens , which we discussed at some length in Chapter 5 , are not scattered haphazardly throughout space . Thanks to the wisdom of Jehovah ’ s “ celestial laws , ” the heavens are beautifully organized into structured galaxies that , in turn , are grouped into clusters that , in turn , combine to form superclusters . ( Job 38 :33 , The New Jerusalem Bible ) No wonder that Jehovah refers to the heavenly bodies as an “ army ” ! ( Isaiah 40 :26 ) There is another army , though , that even more vividly demonstrates Jehovah ’ s wisdom .

5 One important way to climb , as it were , is for you and your spouse to heed the counsel on marriage as found in God ’ s Word . ( Psalm 25 :4 ; Isaiah 48 :17 , 18 ) Consider , therefore , a specific point of counsel stated by the apostle Paul . He said : “ Let marriage be honorable among all . ” ( Hebrews 13 :4 ) What does that mean ? The word “ honorable ” implies that something is esteemed and precious . And that is exactly how Jehovah views marriage—he esteems it as precious .
9 Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth . And Jehovah said to me : “ I have put my words in your mouth . 10 See , I have commissioned you this day to be over the nations and over the kingdoms , to uproot and to pull down , to destroy and to tear down , to build and to plant . ”

8 Some people think that listening to their conscience simply means following their feelings . They think that they can do whatever they want as long as they feel good about it . But our feelings are imperfect , and they can mislead us . Our feelings can be so powerful that they affect our conscience . The Bible says : “ The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate . Who can know it ? ” ( Jeremiah 17 :9 ) So we may begin to think that something is right even though it is wrong . For example , before Paul became a Christian , he viciously persecuted God ’ s people and believed that what he was doing was right . In his opinion , he had a good conscience . But he later said : “ The one who examines me is Jehovah . ” ( 1 Corinthians 4 :4 ; Acts 23 :1 ; 2 Timothy 1 :3 ) When Paul learned how Jehovah felt about what he was doing , he realized that he needed to change . Clearly , before we do something , we need to ask ourselves , ‘ What does Jehovah want me to do ? ’

ALL of Jehovah ’ s servants seek his approval . Desiring to have such , we are eager to improve the quality of our faith and to render sacred service zealously . The apostle Paul , however , draws our attention to a potential danger , one that affected some Jews in his day : “ They have a zeal for God ; but not according to accurate knowledge . ” ( Rom . 10 :2 ) Clearly , our faith and our worship of Jehovah should not be based merely on emotion . We need accurate knowledge of our Creator and his will .

14 So Hil·kiʹah the priest , A·hiʹkam , Achʹbor , Shaʹphan , and A·saiʹah went to Hulʹdah the prophetess . She was the wife of Shalʹlum son of Tikʹvah son of Harʹhas , the caretaker of the wardrobe , and she was dwelling in the Second Quarter of Jerusalem ; and they spoke to her there . 15 She said to them : “ This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says , ‘ Tell the man who sent you to me : 16 “ This is what Jehovah says , ‘ I will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants , all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read . 17 Because they have abandoned me and are making sacrifices smoke to other gods in order to offend me with all the work of their hands , my rage will be set ablaze against this place and it will not be extinguished . ’ ” 18 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of Jehovah , this is what you should say to him , “ This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ Regarding the words that you have heard , 19 because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before Jehovah on hearing what I have spoken against this place and its inhabitants—that they would become an object of horror and a curse—and you ripped your garments apart and wept before me , I also have heard you , declares Jehovah . 20 That is why I will gather you to your ancestors , and you will be laid in your grave in peace , and your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place . ’ ” ’ ” Then they brought the reply to the king .
WHAT does Jehovah require of those who worship him ? In a few simple and profound words , Jesus summarized the answer . The greatest commandment , he said , is to love Jehovah with our whole heart , soul , mind , and strength . ( Matthew 22 :37 ; Mark 12 :30 ) As we have seen in the preceding article , love of God involves obeying him and keeping his commandments in response to the love he has shown us . For those who love God , doing his will is not a burden ; it brings them delight .—Psalm 40 :8 ; 1 John 5 :2 , 3 .

So she painted her eyes with black paint and adorned her head and looked down through the window . 31 As Jeʹhu came in through the gate , she said : “ Did it go well with Zimʹri , the killer of his lord ? ” 32 Looking up to the window , he said : “ Who is on my side ? Who ? ” Immediately two or three court officials looked down at him . 33 He said : “ Throw her down ! ” So they threw her down , and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses , and he trampled her . 34 After that he went in and ate and drank . He then said : “ Please , take care of this accursed woman and bury her . After all , she is the daughter of a king . ” 35 But when they went to bury her , they did not find anything but her skull and her feet and the palms of her hands . 36 When they returned and told him , he said : “ This fulfills the word of Jehovah that he spoke through his servant E·liʹjah the Tishʹbite , saying , ‘ In the plot of land of Jezʹre·el , the dogs will eat the flesh of Jezʹe·bel . 37 And the dead body of Jezʹe·bel will become as manure on the surface of the field in the plot of land of Jezʹre·el , so that they may not say : “ This is Jezʹe·bel . ” ’ ”

The Bible shows that having a clear conscience is not always sufficient . For example , Paul said : “ I am not conscious of anything against myself . But by this I am not proved righteous ; the one who examines me is Jehovah . ” ( 1 Corinthians 4 :4 ) Even those who persecute Christians , as Paul once did , may do so with a clear conscience because they think that God approves of their course . It is vital that our conscience be both clear in our eyes and clean in God ’ s eyes .—Acts 23 :1 ; 2 Timothy 1 :3 .

Many people pray because it makes them feel good , but they do not really believe that God hears their prayers . They need to know that Jehovah is the “ Hearer of prayer . ” Jesus told his disciples : “ If you ask anything in my name , I will do it . ” ( John 14 :14 ) Obviously , “ anything ” means anything that is in harmony with Jehovah ’ s will . John assures us : “ This is the confidence that we have toward him , that no matter what we ask according to his will , he hears us . ” ( 1 John 5 :14 ) How good it is to teach others that far from being a mere psychological crutch , prayer is a wonderful means of approaching Jehovah ’ s “ throne of undeserved kindness ” ! ( Heb . 4 :16 ) By teaching them to pray in the right way , to the right Person , and for the right things , we can help them draw close to Jehovah and find comfort during times of distress .—Ps . 4 :1 ; 145 :18 . w16 .07 4 :11 , 12

But if you endure suffering because of doing good , this is an agreeable thing to God .

18 Does Jehovah ’ s readiness to forgive mean that a repentant sinner is exempted from all consequences of his wrong course ? Not at all . We can not sin with impunity . Paul wrote : “ Whatever a man is sowing , this he will also reap . ” ( Galatians 6 :7 ) We may face certain consequences of our actions . This does not mean that after extending forgiveness Jehovah causes adversity to befall us . When troubles arise , a Christian should not feel , ‘ Perhaps Jehovah is punishing me for past sins . ’ ( James 1 :13 ) On the other hand , Jehovah does not shield us from all the effects of our wrong actions . Divorce , unwanted pregnancy , sexually transmitted disease , loss of trust or respect—all of these may be the sad , unavoidable consequences of sin . Recall that even after forgiving David for his sins in connection with Bath-sheba and Uriah , Jehovah did not protect David from the disastrous consequences that followed .—2 Samuel 12 :9-12 .

11 When the apostle Paul met the young man Timothy , he could see that Timothy loved Jehovah and really cared about the congregation . So Paul trained Timothy to help the brothers and sisters in many different places . ( Acts 16 :1-8 ; 17 :10-14 ) Timothy worked so hard that Paul said : “ He slaved with me to advance the good news . ” Paul knew that Timothy would “ genuinely care ” for the brothers and sisters . As they worked hard together serving Jehovah , Paul and Timothy became good friends .—Philippians 2 :20-22 ; 1 Corinthians 4 :17 .

4 Humility is lowliness of mind , absence of arrogance and pride . An inner quality of the heart , humility is manifest in such traits as mildness , patience , and reasonableness . ( Galatians 5 :22 , 23 ) Never , though , should these godly qualities be mistaken for weakness or timidity . They are not incompatible with Jehovah ’ s righteous anger or his use of destructive power . Rather , by his humility and mildness , Jehovah demonstrates his immense strength , his power to control himself perfectly . ( Isaiah 42 :14 ) How is humility related to wisdom ? One reference work on the Bible notes : “ Humility is finally defined . . . in terms of selflessness and is an essential root of all wisdom . ” Genuine wisdom , then , can not exist apart from humility . How does Jehovah ’ s humility benefit us ?

4 “ Now this is what should take place regarding the manslayer who may flee there in order to live : When he strikes his fellow man unintentionally and he did not previously hate him ; 5 as when he goes with his fellow man into the forest to gather wood and he raises his hand to cut the tree with the ax , but the axhead flies off the handle and hits his fellow man and he dies , the manslayer should flee to one of these cities to live . 6 Otherwise , in the heat of anger , the avenger of blood may chase after the manslayer , overtake him , and kill him , because the distance to the city was too far . However , he did not deserve to die , since he did not previously hate his fellow man . 7 That is why I am commanding you : ‘ Set three cities apart . ’

15 What a fine , unifying effect such faith has ! By means of it , we are drawn closer to Jehovah , to his Son , and to one another within the Christian congregation . ( 1 John 3 :23 , 24 ) It causes us to rejoice that Jehovah has kindly given to his Son “ the name that is above every other name [ except God ’ s name ] , so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground , and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father . ” —Philippians 2 :9-11 .

They knew that he was a runaway , and they did not inform me ! ” But the king ’ s servants did not want to lift their hands to assault the priests of Jehovah . 18 Then the king said to Doʹeg : “ You turn and assault the priests ! ” Immediately Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite went and assaulted the priests himself . He killed on that day 85 men wearing the linen ephʹod . 19 He also struck Nob , the city of the priests , with the sword ; man as well as woman , child as well as infant , bull , donkey , and sheep , he put to the sword .

4 The king then ordered Hil·kiʹah the high priest , the priests of the second rank , and the doorkeepers to bring out from the temple of Jehovah all the utensils made for Baʹal , for the sacred pole , and for all the army of the heavens . Then he burned them outside Jerusalem on the terraces of Kidʹron , and he took their ashes to Bethʹel . 5 So he put out of business the foreign-god priests , whom the kings of Judah had appointed to make sacrificial smoke on the high places in the cities of Judah and the surroundings of Jerusalem , as well as those making sacrificial smoke to Baʹal , to the sun , to the moon , to the constellations of the zodiac , and to all the army of the heavens . 6 He brought the sacred pole out from the house of Jehovah to the outskirts of Jerusalem , to the Kidʹron Valley , and he burned it in the Kidʹron Valley and ground it to dust and scattered its dust on the graves of the common people . 7 He also tore down the houses of the male temple prostitutes , which were in the house of Jehovah and where the women were weaving tent shrines for the sacred pole .

11 “ Love . . . bears all things . ” That expression literally means “ all things it is covering . ” ( Kingdom Interlinear ) First Peter 4 :8 states : “ Love covers a multitude of sins . ” Yes , a Christian who is governed by love is not eager to drag into the light of day all the imperfections and shortcomings of his Christian brothers . In many cases , the mistakes and faults of fellow believers are minor in nature and can be covered by the cloak of love .—Proverbs 10 :12 ; 17 :9 .

6 Stressing the importance of love in true worship , the apostle Paul wrote : “ If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love , I have become a sounding piece of brass or a clashing cymbal . And if I have the gift of prophesying and am acquainted with all the sacred secrets and all knowledge , and if I have all the faith so as to transplant mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing . And if I give all my belongings to feed others , and if I hand over my body , that I may boast , but do not have love , I am not profited at all . ” ( 1 Corinthians 13 :1-3 ) Clearly , love is essential if our worship is to be pleasing to God . How , though , do we show our love for Jehovah ?

13 In 1947 , Brother Aimé Boucher and his daughters Gisèle , aged 18 , and Lucille , aged 11 , were the first to be tried in court on charges of sedition . They had distributed Quebec ’ s Burning Hate tracts near their farm in the hills south of Quebec City , but it was hard to picture them as lawless troublemakers . Brother Boucher was a humble and mild man who quietly tended his small farm and occasionally traveled into town by horse and buggy . Still , his family had endured some of the very abuses mentioned in the tract . The trial court judge , who hated Witnesses , refused to admit evidence that proved the Bouchers ’ innocence . Instead , he accepted the prosecution ’ s position that the tract stirred up ill will and that thus the Bouchers should be found guilty . So the judge ’ s view boiled down to this : It is a crime to tell the truth ! Aimé and Gisèle were convicted of seditious libel , and even young Lucille spent two days locked in jail . The brothers appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada , the land ’ s highest court , which agreed to hear the case .
128 14 How Does Jehovah Direct His Organization ?
3 “ I love the Father . ” Nothing mattered more to Jesus than that . Not that he constantly repeated the statement . In fact , John 14 :31 is the only place in the Bible record where we find Jesus expressing his love for his Father so directly . Yet , Jesus lived those words . His love for Jehovah was in evidence daily . Jesus ’ courage , his obedience , and his endurance were all evidence of his love for God . His entire ministry was motivated by this love .

Jesus knew that while humans look at the outward appearance , God sees what the heart is . ( 1 Sam . 16 :7 ) Our service to God should be motivated by our love for him , not by efforts to impress fellow humans . ( Matt . 6 :5-8 ) On the other hand , the Pharisees did many things for outward show . They put great emphasis on conformity to details of the Law and compliance with rules of their own making . But they failed to manifest in their lives the qualities that would identify them with the God whom they professed to worship . ( Matt . 9 :13 ; Luke 11 :42 ) Jesus taught that while obedience to God ’ s requirements is important , the value of such obedience is determined by what is in the heart . ( Matt . 15 :7-9 ; Mark 7 :20-23 ; John 3 :36 ) Our teaching will accomplish the greatest good if we imitate Jesus ’ example . It is important that we help people to learn what God requires of them . But it is also important for them to know and love Jehovah as a person so that their conduct becomes a reflection of the value they place on an approved relationship with the true God .

9 “ Love is . . . kind . ” Kindness is shown by helpful acts and considerate words . Love moves us to look for ways to show kindness , especially toward those most in need . For instance , an older fellow believer may be lonely and in need of an encouraging visit . A single mother or a sister living in a religiously divided home may need some assistance . One who is ill or facing some adversity may need to hear kind words from a loyal friend . ( Proverbs 12 :25 ; 17 :17 ) When we take the initiative to show kindness in such ways , we demonstrate the genuineness of our love .—2 Corinthians 8 :8 .

( Read Hebrews 12 :3 . ) Like Jesus , early Christian martyrs , such as the disciple Antipas , refused to compromise their integrity . ( Rev . 2 :13 ) They would have the reward of a resurrection to heavenly life—surpassing the “ better resurrection ” that ancient men of faith looked forward to . ( Heb . 11 :35 ) Sometime after the Kingdom ’ s birth in 1914 , all such faithful anointed ones , who were sleeping in death , were raised to spirit life in heaven to share with Jesus in his rulership over mankind .—Rev . 20 :4 .

2 After the Kingdom was established in 1914 , some of the strongest military powers in history tried to wipe out God ’ s people . But none have conquered us . Many governments and political factions tried to force us to take sides in their conflicts . They did not succeed in dividing us . Today , subjects of the Kingdom live in virtually every nation on earth . Even so , we are united in a genuine global brotherhood , remaining strictly neutral as to the world ’ s political affairs . Our unity provides compelling evidence that God ’ s Kingdom rules and that the King Jesus Christ continues to direct , refine , and protect his subjects . Consider how he has done so , and note just some of the faith-strengthening legal victories he has given us as we continue to remain “ no part of the world . ” —John 17 :14 .

18 Of course , immigrants will want to do their best to adjust to the culture of the new country . Ruth set a fine example in this regard . First , she showed respect for the customs of her new country by asking permission to glean . ( Ruth 2 :7 ) She did not take this right for granted as if others owed her something . Second , she readily expressed gratitude for the kindnesses shown to her . ( Ruth 2 :13 ) When immigrants display such a fine attitude , they are more likely to gain the respect of local residents and fellow believers .
Cultivating Love for God
6 He keeps them established forever and ever ;
We do not need to be in doubt as to the “ end afterward ” of the paths that life ’ s journey may offer . From his vantage point , God is in a unique position to advise all human travelers about the best road to take . He has seen the many ways that humans have traveled and has observed the outcome . The Bible says : “ The ways of man are in front of the eyes of Jehovah , and he is contemplating all his tracks . ” —Proverbs 5 :21 .

4 . In the Mosaic Law , how did God stress the proper view of life ?
17 The Scriptures make it clear that older ones can continue to prosper spiritually despite the problems accompanying old age . The psalmist declared : “ Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah . . . will still keep on thriving during gray-headedness , fat and fresh they will continue to be . ” ( Ps . 92 :13 , 14 ) The apostle Paul , who may have been dealing with a physical affliction , ‘ did not give up , even if the man he was on the outside was wasting away . ’ —Read 2 Corinthians 4 :16-18 .
32 While the Israelites were in the wilderness , they found a man collecting pieces of wood on the Sabbath day . 33 Those who found him collecting wood brought him up to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly . 34 They committed him into custody because it had not been specified what should be done to him .
48 Now his betrayer had given them a sign , saying : “ Whoever it is I kiss , he is the one ; take him into custody . ” 49 And going straight up to Jesus , he said : “ Greetings , Rabbi ! ” and gave him a tender kiss . 50 But Jesus said to him : “ Fellow , for what purpose are you present ? ” Then they came forward and seized Jesus and took him into custody . 51 But look ! one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest , taking off his ear . 52 Then Jesus said to him : “ Return your sword to its place , for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword . 53 Or do you think that I can not appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than 12 legions of angels ? 54 In that case , how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must take place this way ? ” 55 In that hour Jesus said to the crowds : “ Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber ? Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching , and yet you did not take me into custody . 56 But all of this has taken place for the writings of the prophets to be fulfilled . ” Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled .

Out of loyalty to the Kingdom , God ’ s people remain no part of the world
26 And they put in to shore in the region of the Gerʹa·senes , which is on the side opposite Galʹi·lee . 27 As Jesus got out onto land , a demon-possessed man from the city met him . For a considerable time he had not worn clothing , and he was staying , not in a house , but among the tombs . 28 At the sight of Jesus , he cried out and fell down before him , and with a loud voice , he said : “ What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , do not torment me . ” 29 ( For Jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man . It had seized him on many occasions , and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard , but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places . ) 30 Jesus asked him : “ What is your name ? ” He said : “ Legion , ” for many demons had entered into him . 31 And they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss . 32 Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain , so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine , and he gave them permission . 33 With that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine , and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned . 34 But when the herders saw what had happened , they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside .

On Tuesday , October 3 , 1933 , the Supreme Court announced its decision . It agreed with the lower court that August Lehmann had not broken the law . This ruling meant that the Witnesses could continue to preach freely . To express their gratitude to Jehovah for giving this legal victory , the brothers and sisters increased their preaching activities even more . Ever since that Court decision , our brothers in Denmark have been able to carry out their ministry without government interference .

Truly I say to you , they have their reward in full . 3 But you , when making gifts of mercy , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing , 4 so that your gifts of mercy may be in secret . Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you .

17 Jehovah proves his love for us by helping us individually to take advantage of the benefits of Christ ’ s sacrifice . Jesus said : “ No man can come to me unless the Father , who sent me , draws him . ” ( John 6 :44 ) Yes , Jehovah personally draws us toward his Son and the hope of eternal life . How ? By means of the preaching work , which reaches us individually , and by means of his holy spirit , which Jehovah uses to help us grasp and apply spiritual truths despite our limitations and imperfections . Jehovah can therefore say of us as he said of Israel : “ With a love to time indefinite I have loved you . That is why I have drawn you with loving-kindness . ” —Jeremiah 31 :3 .

When we are born , we have not yet done anything with our life , either good or bad . But when we use our life to serve Jehovah and do good for others , we build “ a good name , ” or reputation , and Jehovah will remember us even after we have died . ( Job 14 :14 , 15 ) Jehovah ’ s people do not celebrate their own birthday or that of Jesus . In fact , the only event Jesus commanded us to observe is the Memorial of his death .—Luke 22 :17-20 ; Hebrews 1 :3 , 4 .

To that end , various schools have been established to help qualified brothers to be more effective in serving their fellow believers .

17 Our home and surroundings . Our home may not be fancy or luxurious , but it should be as clean and presentable as circumstances permit . Likewise , if we use an automobile for transportation to meetings and in the field ministry , we can do our best to keep it reasonably clean , inside and out . Let us not forget that a clean home and surroundings are a witness in themselves . After all , we teach people that Jehovah is a clean God , that he will “ bring to ruin those ruining the earth , ” and that his Kingdom will soon transform our earthly home into a paradise . ( Revelation 11 :18 ; Luke 23 :43 ) Surely we want the appearance of our home and belongings to show others that even now we are developing clean habits that will fit in with the coming new world .

So Jehovah said in his heart : “ Never again will I curse the ground on man ’ s account , for the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up ; and never again will I strike down every living thing as I have done . 22 From now on , the earth will never cease to have seed-sowing and harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , and day and night . ”

10 When would faithful anointed Christians experience that heavenly resurrection ? The Bible indicates that it has already begun . The apostle Paul explained that they would be raised ‘ during Christ ’ s presence , ’ which presence began in the year 1914 . ( 1 Corinthians 15 :23 ) When anointed faithful ones finish their earthly course now during his presence , they do not have to remain in death until the return of their Lord . As soon as they die , they are raised up in the spirit , being “ changed , in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye . ” What happiness is theirs , since the good works they did “ go right with them ” ! —1 Corinthians 15 :51 , 52 ; Revelation 14 :13 .

13 People differ for many reasons . Backgrounds vary greatly . Some , for instance , are acutely aware of a weakness that they have struggled with in the past—perhaps not always successfully .

If such a person comes to your home for a visit , his conscience may rightly move him to refuse the offer of a drink . Will you be offended ? Will you insist ? No . Whether you know his reasons or not—reasons that he may choose to keep private in this setting—brotherly love will move you to be considerate .

20 We also build others up when we give good advice . As imperfect people , we all need advice from time to time . Proverbs 19 :20 says : “ Listen to counsel and accept discipline , in order to become wise in your future . ” Elders are not the only ones who can offer advice or give counsel . Parents need to guide their children . ( Ephesians 6 :4 ) And sisters can give good advice to one another . ( Titus 2 :3-5 ) Because we love our brothers and sisters , we want to make sure that we give advice in a way that will not make them feel bad . What can help us ?

22 For three years there was no war between Syria and Israel . 2 In the third year King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah went down to the king of Israel . 3 Then the king of Israel said to his servants : “ Do you know that Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad belongs to us ? And yet we are hesitating to take it back from the king of Syria . ” 4 He then said to Je·hoshʹa·phat : “ Will you go with me to fight at Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad ? ” Je·hoshʹa·phat replied to the king of Israel : “ I am the same as you . My people are the same as your people . My horses are the same as your horses . ”

15 Now after our enemies heard that what they were doing had become known to us and that the true God had frustrated their plan , we all went back to work on the wall . 16 From that day forward , half of my men would do the work and half of them would hold the lances , the shields , the bows , and the coats of mail . And the princes stood behind the whole house of Judah 17 who were building the wall . Those who were carrying the loads did the work with one hand while holding a weapon in the other hand . 18 And each of the builders had a sword strapped to his hip while building , and the one to blow the horn stood beside me .

24 In Je·hoiʹa·kim ’ s days King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon came against him , and Je·hoiʹa·kim became his servant for three years . However , he turned against him and rebelled . 2 Then Jehovah began to send against him marauder bands of Chal·deʹans , Syrians , Moʹab·ites , and Amʹmon·ites . He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it , according to Jehovah ’ s word that he had spoken through his servants the prophets . 3 Surely it was by the order of Jehovah that this happened to Judah , to remove them from his sight because of all the sins that Ma·nasʹseh had committed , 4 and also the innocent blood that he had shed , for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood and Jehovah was not willing to forgive .
15 The problem was not trivial to the bride and groom . In the ancient Middle East , hospitality to invited guests was of profound importance . Running out of wine at the wedding feast would have caused the bride and groom considerable shame and embarrassment , casting a pall over their wedding day and their memories of it in the years that followed . The problem mattered to them , and it mattered to Jesus . So he did something about it . Can you see why people would approach him with their concerns ?

When Jesus sees this woman , his heart is touched by her extreme grief and the sadness of her situation . Tenderly and yet with assurance that imparts confidence , he tells her : “ Stop weeping . ” Yet , he does more . He approaches and touches the bier on which the body is being carried . ( Luke 7 :13 , 14 ) His manner and actions are such that the mourning townspeople stop in their tracks . ‘ What does he mean , and what is he going to do ? ’ many must wonder .

15 This is the account of those whom King Solʹo·mon conscripted for forced labor to build the house of Jehovah , his own house , the Mound , the wall of Jerusalem , Haʹzor , Me·gidʹdo , and Geʹzer . 16 ( Pharʹaoh king of Egypt had come up and captured Geʹzer and had burned it with fire , and he had also killed the Caʹnaan·ites dwelling in the city . So he gave it as a parting gift to his daughter , the wife of Solʹo·mon . ) 17 Solʹo·mon built up Geʹzer , Lower Beth-hoʹron , 18 Baʹal·ath , and Taʹmar in the wilderness , within the land , 19 as well as all of Solʹo·mon ’ s storage cities , the chariot cities , the cities for the horsemen , and whatever Solʹo·mon desired to build in Jerusalem , in Lebʹa·non , and in all the land of his dominion . 20 As for all the people who were left from the Amʹor·ites , the Hitʹtites , the Perʹiz·zites , the Hiʹvites , and the Jebʹu·sites , who were not part of the people of Israel , 21 their descendants who were left in the land—those whom the Israelites had been unable to devote to destruction—were conscripted by Solʹo·mon for forced labor as slaves until this day . 22 But Solʹo·mon did not make any of the Israelites slaves , for they were his warriors , servants , princes , adjutants , and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen . 23 There were 550 chiefs of the deputies who were over the work of Solʹo·mon , the foremen over the people who were doing the work .

8 Significantly , the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament observes that this word ( koʹpher ) “ always denotes an equivalent , ” or a correspondency . Thus , the cover of the ark of the covenant had a shape corresponding to the ark itself . Likewise , in order to ransom , or cover , sin , a price must be paid that fully corresponds to , or fully covers , the damage caused by the sin . God ’ s Law to Israel thus stated : “ Soul will be for soul , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot . ” —Deuteronomy 19 :21 .

But Christians are careful to avoid any customs that are connected to false religion .—Read 2 Corinthians 6 :14-18 .

11 What may we pray for ? The Bible explains : “ No matter what we ask according to his will , [ Jehovah ] hears us . ” ( 1 John 5 :14 ) So we may pray for anything that is in harmony with God ’ s will . Is it his will that we pray about personal concerns ? By all means ! Praying to Jehovah can be much like talking to a close friend . We may speak openly , ‘ pouring out our heart ’ to God . ( Psalm 62 :8 ) It is proper for us to ask for holy spirit , for it will help us to do what is right . ( Luke 11 :13 ) We can also ask for guidance in making wise decisions and for strength in coping with difficulties . ( James 1 :5 ) When we sin , we should ask for forgiveness on the basis of Christ ’ s sacrifice . ( Ephesians 1 :3 , 7 ) Of course , personal matters should not be the only subjects of our prayers . We should broaden out our prayers to include other people—family members as well as fellow worshippers .—Acts 12 :5 ; Colossians 4 :12 .

We quickly grew fond of Kenya and our delightful ministry there . Our first progressive Bible study was with Chris and Mary Kanaiya . They still serve faithfully in the full-time service in Kenya . The following year , we were asked to go to Kampala , Uganda , as the first missionaries in that country . Those were exciting times because so many had a keen desire to learn Bible truths , and they became our fellow Witnesses . However , after three and a half years in Africa , we left to have a family . We returned to the United States . The day we left Africa , the lump in our throat was much bigger than the one we had when leaving New York . We had grown to love the people of Africa and hoped to return someday .

SHADOWS created by the sun do not remain still . As the earth moves , the shadows are ever shifting and changing . The Creator of earth and sun , however , does not change . ( Mal . 3 :6 ) “ With him , ” the Bible says , “ there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow . ” ( Jas . 1 :17 ) This fundamental truth about Jehovah is truly a source of comfort and strength for us , especially when we face difficult trials and challenges . Why ?
17 What is the outcome if we maintain a spiritual focus ? Romans 8 :6 answers clearly : “ Setting the mind on the spirit means life and peace . ” That implies letting our mind be influenced by and dominated by holy spirit and being in harmony with God and his thoughts . We can trust that by making “ the spirit ” the real center of our existence , we will have a satisfying , meaningful life now . And the lasting result is everlasting life , be that in heaven or on earth .

Jesus did say : “ You must accordingly be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect . ” ( Matt . 5 :48 ) He evidently understood that even imperfect humans can be complete , or perfect , in a relative sense . We can fulfill the command to love others generously , thereby pleasing God . Jehovah , however , is perfect in the absolute sense . When applied to him , the term “ integrity ” also involves perfection .—Ps . 18 :30 .

13 We can likewise expect our assignments to change from time to time , often because of decisions we make . For example , were you single , but then you got married ? Have you begun raising children ? In your later years , have you simplified your life to take up the full-time ministry ? Each of those decisions came with certain privileges and responsibilities . Our changing circumstances can expand or limit our sphere of operation . Are you young or up in years ? Is your health good or fragile ? Jehovah always considers how each of us might best be used in his service . He only expects from us what is reasonable , and he greatly appreciates whatever we do .—Heb . 6 :10 .

19 Even Judah did not keep the commandments of Jehovah their God ; they also walked in the customs that Israel followed . 20 Jehovah rejected all the descendants of Israel and humiliated them and gave them into the hand of plunderers , until he had cast them away from before him . 21 He ripped Israel away from the house of David , and they made Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat king . But Jer·o·boʹam caused Israel to stray from following Jehovah , and he caused them to commit a great sin . 22 And the people of Israel kept walking in all the sins that Jer·o·boʹam had committed . They did not depart from them 23 until Jehovah removed Israel from his sight , just as he had declared through all his servants the prophets . So Israel was taken into exile from its land to As·syrʹi·a , where they remain to this day .

Pour out the alcoholic drink in the holy place as a drink offering to Jehovah . 8 And you will offer the other male lamb at twilight . With the same grain offering as that made in the morning and with its same drink offering , you will present it as an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah .

How long would the foretold preaching work continue ? Jesus said that this global work would continue right on through the last days , “ and then the end [ would ] come . ” What other religious group has continued to preach the good news during these momentous last days ? Some of those whom we meet in the ministry may say : “ We have the holy spirit , but you people are doing the work . ” But is not the fact that we can endure in the work evidence that we have God ’ s spirit ? ( Acts 1 :8 ; 1 Pet . 4 :14 ) From time to time , certain religious groups have tried to do what Jehovah ’ s Witnesses regularly accomplish , but those efforts usually result in failure . Others engage in so-called missionary activities for a limited time and then go back to their normal routine . Still others may even try to go from door to door , but what are they preaching ? The answer to that question makes it clear that they are not carrying out the work that Christ began . w16 .05 2 :13 , 16

You have hastened the end of your days , and the end of your years has come . That is why I will make you an object of reproach to the nations and an object of mockery to all the lands . 5 The lands nearby and those far away from you will mock you , you whose name is unclean and who are filled with turmoil . 6 Look !

Even Saul and his son Jonʹa·than have died . ” 5 Then David asked the young man who brought him the news : “ How do you know that Saul and his son Jonʹa·than are dead ? ” 6 The young man replied : “ By chance I was on Mount Gil·boʹa , and there was Saul supporting himself on his spear , and the chariots and horsemen had caught up with him . 7 When he turned around and saw me , he called me , and I said , ‘ Here I am ! ’ 8 He asked me , ‘ Who are you ? ’ I replied , ‘ I am an A·malʹek·ite . ’ 9 Then he said , ‘ Please stand over me and put me to death , for I am in great agony , but I am still alive . ’ 10 So I stood over him and put him to death , for I knew that he could not survive after he had fallen down wounded . Then I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm , and I brought them here to my lord . ”

They , in turn , paid it to the woodworkers and to the builders who were working at the house of Jehovah , 12 as well as to the masons and the stonecutters . They also bought timbers and hewn stones for repairing the damage to the house of Jehovah and used the money for all the other expenses incurred in repairing the house .

3 Our conscience is a wonderful gift from Jehovah . It is the sense of right and wrong that we have inside us . The Greek word used in the Bible for “ conscience ” means “ knowledge with oneself . ” When our conscience works well , it helps us examine the person we really are . It can help us to be honest about our deepest thoughts and feelings . It can guide us toward good and away from bad . And it can make us feel happy when we make a wise decision or guilty after we make a bad one .—See Endnote 5 .

How is it you say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ” 34 Jesus answered them : “ Most truly I say to you , every doer of sin is a slave of sin . 35 Moreover , the slave does not remain in the household forever ; the son remains forever . 36 So if the Son sets you free , you will be truly free . 37 I know that you are Abraham ’ s offspring . But you are seeking to kill me , because my word makes no progress among you . 38 I speak the things I have seen while with my Father , but you do the things you have heard from your father . ” 39 In answer they said to him : “ Our father is Abraham . ” Jesus said to them : “ If you were Abraham ’ s children , you would be doing the works of Abraham . 40 But now you are seeking to kill me , a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God . Abraham did not do this . 41 You are doing the works of your father . ” They said to him : “ We were not born from immorality ; we have one Father , God . ”

The one door had two leaves that turned on pivots , and the other door had two leaves that turned on pivots . 35 He carved cherubs , palm trees , and flowers in bloom , and overlaid gold foil on the carvings .
These disciples are not to focus on teaching in synagogues . Jesus tells them to go to people ’ s homes . “ Wherever you enter into a house , ” he instructs , “ say first : ‘ May this house have peace . ’ And if a friend of peace is there , your peace will rest upon him . ” What is to be their message ? Jesus says : “ Tell them : ‘ The Kingdom of God has come near to you . ’ ” —Luke 10 :5-9 .
28 In those days the Phi·lisʹtines assembled their armies for war against Israel . So Aʹchish said to David : “ You know , of course , that you and your men will go out into battle with me . ” 2 At that David said to Aʹchish : “ You surely know what your servant will do . ” Aʹchish said to David : “ That is why I will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard . ”

7 Hebrews 11 :7 highlights the faith of Noah who , “ after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen , showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household . ” Noah exercised his faith by building the gigantic ark . Without doubt , his neighbors must have asked him why he was building such a colossal structure . Did Noah keep quiet or tell them to mind their own business ? By no means ! His faith moved him to witness boldly and to warn his contemporaries of God ’ s coming judgment . Quite likely , Noah repeated to the people the exact words that Jehovah had spoken to him : “ I have decided to put an end to all flesh , because the earth is full of violence on account of them . . . I am going to bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy from under the heavens all flesh that has the breath of life . Everything on the earth will perish . ” Also , Noah no doubt explained to the people the only means of escape , repeating God ’ s command : “ You must go into the ark . ” Thus , Noah further exercised his faith by being “ a preacher of righteousness . ” —Gen . 6 :13 , 17 , 18 ; 2 Pet . 2 :5 .

12 Jehovah went on to say to Moses : 2 “ Tell the Israelites , ‘ If a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a male , she will be unclean for seven days , just as she is in the days of the impurity when she is menstruating . 3 On the eighth day , the flesh of his foreskin will be circumcised . 4 She will continue cleansing herself from the blood for the next 33 days . She should not touch any holy thing , and she should not come into the holy place until she fulfills the days of her purification .
And he bore our pains .

LESSON 15
With many handshakes we’ll make our society more welcoming . Answer a question today !
“ He is in no position to counsel me ! ” If we think that personal faults in the counselor invalidate his counsel , we need to remember the points noted above . Likewise , if we think that our age , experience , or responsibilities in the congregation somehow put us above counsel , we need to readjust our thinking . In ancient Israel , the king had great responsibilities , yet he had to accept counsel from prophets , priests , and others who were among his subjects . ( 2 Samuel 12 :1-13 ; 2 Chronicles 26 :16-20 ) Today , Jehovah ’ s organization appoints imperfect men to offer counsel , and mature Christians gladly accept it and apply it . If we have greater responsibilities or experience than others do , we should be even more conscious of the need to set an example in reasonableness and humility by accepting counsel and applying it .—1 Timothy 3 :2 , 3 ; Titus 3 :2 .

19 When Herod had died , look ! Jehovah ’ s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 20 and said : “ Get up , take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel , for those who were seeking the life of the young child are dead . ” 21 So he got up and took the young child and the child ’ s mother and entered into the land of Israel . 22 But hearing that Ar·che·laʹus ruled Ju·deʹa instead of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . Moreover , being given divine warning in a dream , he withdrew into the territory of Galʹi·lee . 23 And he came and settled in a city named Nazʹa·reth , in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets : “ He will be called a Naz·a·reneʹ . ”
14 Armenia . Vahan Bayatyan became eligible for compulsory military service in 2001 . He conscientiously objected to serving in the military but lost every appeal in the domestic courts . In September 2002 , he began serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence but was released after serving ten and a half months . During that time , he appealed to the ECHR , which heard his case . However , on October 27 , 2009 , that Court also ruled against him . The verdict seemed to be a crushing blow to the brothers in Armenia who faced this issue . However , the Grand Chamber of the ECHR reviewed the ruling . On July 7 , 2011 , the Court ruled in favor of Vahan Bayatyan . This was the first time that the ECHR recognized that conscientious objection to military service based on one ’ s religious beliefs should be protected under the right of freedom of thought , conscience , and religion . That ruling protects the rights not only of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses but of hundreds of millions of people in countries that are members of the Council of Europe .

Although we seek the spiritual welfare of people by endeavoring to share with them “ the glorious good news of the happy God ” and his Son , they may be apathetic or ungrateful .

8 Consider the freedoms we enjoy as Christians . We have been liberated from the effects of false teachings , from bondage to superstition , and from servitude to sin . The grand truths about the condition of the dead and the resurrection have freed us from unreasoning fear of death . Knowledge that imperfect human governments will soon be replaced by God ’ s righteous Kingdom frees us from hopelessness . ( Daniel 2 :44 ; Matthew 6 :10 ) However , such freedom does not justify disrespect for governmental authorities and their laws .—Titus 3 :1 , 2 ; 1 Peter 2 :16 , 17 .

8 Showing that just a word of encouragement does not always suffice , Paul told the elders from Ephesus : “ You must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus , when he himself said : ‘ There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ’ ” ( Acts 20 :35 ) Paul was willing not only to encourage his brothers but also to “ spend and be completely spent for ” them . ( 2 Cor . 12 :15 ) Similarly , elders should not only encourage and console their brothers with words but also build them up by showing sincere personal interest .—1 Cor . 14 :3 .

This renewed emphasis on the ministry thrilled many . “ It was a call to action from headquarters , which most of us had been longing for and which soon brought wonderful results , ” recalled Hilda Padgett . Sister E . F . Wallis reported : “ The five-hour day suggestion was grand ! What greater joy could there be than putting in whole days at a time in the Lord ’ s service ? . . . We returned tired , maybe , but joyful ? I ’ ll say ! ” Young Stephen Miller felt the sense of urgency and responded to the call . He wanted to do it while he had the opportunity ! He remembered groups on bicycles spending whole days in the ministry and in the summer evenings playing recorded talks . They zealously shared in information marches with placards and did street witnessing with magazines .

2 Those officers were not mistaken . Jesus was unquestionably the greatest Teacher who ever lived . He taught with clarity , simplicity , and irrefutable logic . He skillfully used illustrations and questions . He adapted his teaching to those to whom he spoke , whether they were of high station or low . The truths he taught were easy to grasp yet truly profound . However , these things alone did not make Jesus the great Teacher that he was .
Gently they guide the way .
10 In some cases , single Christians have come to the conclusion that an uneven yoking would be better than the loneliness they currently feel . Some decide to ignore Bible counsel , and they marry a person who does not serve Jehovah . Again and again , the outcome is sad . Such ones find themselves married to a person with whom they can not share the most important things in life . The loneliness that results may be far greater than any that they experienced before they married . Happily , there are many thousands of single Christians who trust in and loyally adhere to divine counsel in this regard . ( Read Psalm 32 :8 . ) Though hoping to marry someday , they remain single until they find a mate among those who worship Jehovah God .

17 Jesus saw fit to entrust his disciples with even weightier responsibilities . As we noted earlier , he delegated to a small group of his anointed followers on earth the important responsibility of dispensing spiritual food . ( Luke 12 :42-44 ) Recall , too , that he placed in the hands of his disciples the weighty commission to preach and make disciples . ( Matthew 28 :18-20 ) Even now , though invisible and ruling from heaven , Jesus entrusts his congregation on earth to the care of spiritually qualified “ gifts in men . ” —Ephesians 4 :8 , 11 , 12 .

16 Consider how Paul handled a problem that arose in the Syrian city of Antioch . The Christian congregation there was split over the issue of circumcision . ( Acts 14 :26–15 :2 ) Since Paul had been appointed to take the lead in preaching to the uncircumcised Gentiles , he might have thought of himself as an expert in dealing with non-Jews and therefore well-qualified to resolve the problem . ( Read Galatians 2 :8 , 9 . ) When his efforts did not seem to clear up the issue , however , with humility and modesty , he went along with arrangements to approach the governing body in Jerusalem to discuss the matter . He cooperated fully as its members listened to the matter , reached a decision , and assigned him to be one of their messengers . ( Acts 15 :22-31 ) Thus Paul ‘ took the lead in showing honor ’ to his fellow servants .—Rom . 12 :10b .

( Ps . 72 :12-16 ) He will do the same for all the other distressful conditions that make life miserable today . He will even drive away the bad “ air ” of this world system , for the bad spirit of Satan and his demons will be gone at last .—Eph . 2 :2 .

8 God ’ s will is that “ all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ” ( 1 Tim . 2 :4 ) What is your view of the many sorts of people who have yet to learn the truth ? Although the apostle Paul searched in synagogues for those who already knew something about God , he certainly did not restrict his efforts to Jewish people . The responses he received from those who worshipped other deities would test the depth of his humility .
Self-examination is important . Why ? Paul wrote : “ Setting the mind on the flesh means death . ” ( Rom . 8 :6 ) That is serious—spiritual death now and physical death in the future . Still , Paul did not mean that if someone began to ‘ set the mind on the flesh ’ his end unavoidably would be death . Change is possible . Think of the immoral man in Corinth who went after “ the flesh ” and had to be disfellowshipped . Yet , he could and did change . He ceased to walk after the flesh and returned to a straight path . ( 2 Cor . 2 :6-8 ) If it was possible for that person to change , it is possible for a Christian today to change , especially one who has not gone after the flesh as far as the man in Corinth had . Certainly , Paul ’ s warning about the possible final outcome for someone who ‘ sets his or her mind on the flesh ’ should be a stimulus to Christians to make any needed changes ! w16 .12 2 :5 , 12 , 13

26 In ancient Israel , Jehovah told the prophet Ezekiel to warn people that Jerusalem would soon be destroyed and to teach them what they needed to do to survive . If Ezekiel did not warn the people , Jehovah would hold him responsible for their lives . ( Ezekiel 33 :7-9 ) Ezekiel showed that he valued life by doing all he could to share that important message .
We need to follow the Bible-based direction we receive from the elders . Recall Paul ’ s counsel regarding disorderly ones in the congregation . Some individuals were ‘ meddling with what did not concern them . ’ They were evidently admonished by the elders but persisted in disregarding the counsel . How was the congregation to deal with such a person ? Paul directed : “ Keep this one marked and stop associating with him . ” That counsel was balanced with the caution not to treat such a person as an enemy . ( 2 Thess . 3 :11-15 ) Today , elders may give a warning talk about someone ’ s persisting in a course that reflects badly on the congregation , such as dating an unbeliever . ( 1 Cor . 7 :39 ) How do you react to their counsel ? If you are aware of the situation described in the talk , will you take care to avoid socializing with such an individual ? Your loving concern and firm stand may move the person to abandon a disorderly course . w16 .11 2 :13

The things I say to you I do not speak of my own originality , but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works . 11 Believe me that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me ; otherwise , believe because of the works themselves . 12 Most truly I say to you , whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works that I do ; and he will do works greater than these , because I am going my way to the Father . 13 Also , whatever you ask in my name , I will do this , so that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son . 14 If you ask anything in my name , I will do it .

Ah , these are the “ nuggets ” he keeps ! Have you ever noticed the way fond parents treasure their children ’ s drawings or school projects , sometimes for decades after the children have forgotten them ? Jehovah is the fondest Parent . As long as we remain faithful to him , he never forgets our good works and qualities . In fact , he would view it as unrighteous to forget these , and he is never unrighteous . ( Hebrews 6 :10 ) He also sifts us in another way .

6 The Ark of Jehovah was in Phi·lisʹtine territory for seven months . 2 The Phi·lisʹtines called the priests and the diviners and asked : “ What should we do with the Ark of Jehovah ? Let us know how we should send it back to its place . ” 3 They replied : “ If you send the ark of the covenant of Jehovah the God of Israel away , do not send it back without an offering . You should by all means return to him a guilt offering . Only then will you be healed , and it will be made known to you why his hand has not turned away from you . ” 4 So they asked : “ What guilt offering should we send to him ? ” They said : “ According to the number of the lords of the Phi·lisʹtines , send five golden piles and five golden mice , for the same scourge has afflicted every one of you and your lords . 5 You should make images of your piles and images of your mice that are bringing the land to ruin , and you should honor the God of Israel . Perhaps he will lighten the weight of his hand that is on you and your god and your land . 6 Why should you harden your heart as Egypt and Pharʹaoh hardened their hearts ? When He dealt harshly with them , they had to send Israel away , and they departed . 7 Now prepare a new wagon and two cows that have calves and have never been under a yoke . Then hitch the cows to the wagon , but take their calves back home , away from them . 8 Take the Ark of Jehovah and place it on the wagon , and put the golden articles that you are sending to him as a guilt offering in a box next to it . Then send it on its way 9 and watch : If it goes up the road to Beth-sheʹmesh , to its own territory , then he is the one who has done this great evil to us . But if not , we will know that it was not his hand that struck us ; it happened to us by coincidence . ”

26 If we want to be Jehovah ’ s friend , we may see that we need to make some changes . If so , we should start right away . It is not always easy to stop an unclean habit , but we can do it !

6 After these things were constructed this way , the priests enter the first tent compartment regularly to perform the sacred services ; 7 but the high priest enters alone into the second compartment once a year , not without blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins that the people committed in ignorance . 8 Thus the holy spirit makes it clear that the way into the holy place had not yet been revealed while the first tent was standing . 9 This tent is an illustration for the present time , and according to this arrangement , both gifts and sacrifices are offered . However , these are not able to make the conscience of the man doing sacred service perfect . 10 They have to do only with foods and drinks and various ceremonial washings . They were legal requirements concerning the body and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight .

As a matter of fact , Jehovah God has the means , the desire , and the power to end all suffering and to bring relief from the effects of natural disasters . Regarding God ’ s appointed King , Jesus Christ , Psalm 72 :12 foretold : “ He will deliver the poor one crying for help , also the afflicted one and whoever has no helper . ”
9 When we obey Jehovah , we have a happy and satisfying life . ( Isaiah 48 :17 , 18 ) But what will help us to stay close to Jehovah ? Let us see .

2 As a young servant of Jehovah or as someone learning about Him , do you feel under pressure to conform to popular beliefs , such as evolution , rather than believe in a Creator ? If so , there are steps you can take to strengthen your faith and keep it strong . One step is for you to use your God-given thinking ability , which “ will keep watch over you . ” It will protect you from secular philosophies that could destroy your faith .—Read Proverbs 2 :10-12 .

15 The sons of Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh were Iʹru , Eʹlah , and Naʹam ; and the son of Eʹlah was Keʹnaz . 16 The sons of Je·halʹle·lel were Ziph , Ziʹphah , Tirʹi·a , and Asʹa·rel . 17 The sons of Ezʹrah were Jeʹther , Meʹred , Eʹpher , and Jaʹlon ; she conceived and bore Mirʹi·am , Shamʹmai , and Ishʹbah the father of Esh·te·moʹa . 18 ( And his Jewish wife gave birth to Jeʹred the father of Geʹdor , Heʹber the father of Soʹco , and Je·kuʹthi·el the father of Za·noʹah . ) These were the sons of Bi·thiʹah , the daughter of Pharʹaoh , whom Meʹred married .

32 Then Jehovah ’ s angel said to him : “ Why have you beaten your donkey these three times ? Look ! I myself came out to offer resistance , because your way is in defiance of my will . 33 The donkey saw me and tried to turn away from me these three times . Supposing it had not turned away from me ! By now I would have killed you and let the donkey live . ” 34 Baʹlaam said to Jehovah ’ s angel : “ I have sinned , because I did not know that it was you standing in the road to meet me . And now if it is bad in your eyes , I will go back . ” 35 But Jehovah ’ s angel said to Baʹlaam : “ Go with the men , but you may speak only the words that I tell you . ” So Baʹlaam continued going with the princes of Baʹlak .
18 Now why do you wish for the way to Egypt
14 So Hagʹgai said : “ ‘ That is how this people is , and that is how this nation is before me , ’ declares Jehovah , ‘ and that is how all the work of their hands is ; whatever they present there is unclean . ’

11 If , then , perfection was attainable through the Levitical priesthood ( for it was a feature of the Law that was given to the people ) , what further need would there be for another priest to arise who is said to be in the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek and not in the manner of Aaron ? 12 For since the priesthood is being changed , it becomes necessary to change the Law as well . 13 For the man about whom these things are said came from another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar . 14 For it is clear that our Lord has descended from Judah , yet Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe .

4 Samuel did what Jehovah said . When he came to Bethʹle·hem , the elders of the city were trembling at meeting him , and they said : “ Does your coming mean peace ? ” 5 To this he said : “ It means peace . I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah . Sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . ” Then he sanctified Jesʹse and his sons , after which he summoned them to the sacrifice . 6 As they came in and he saw E·liʹab , he said : “ Surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one . ” 7 But Jehovah said to Samuel : “ Do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is , for I have rejected him . For the way man sees is not the way God sees , because mere man sees what appears to the eyes , but Jehovah sees into the heart . ” 8 Then Jesʹse called A·binʹa·dab and had him pass before Samuel , but he said : “ Jehovah has not chosen this one either . ” 9 Next Jesʹse presented Shamʹmah , but he said : “ Jehovah has not chosen this one either . ” 10 So Jesʹse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel , but Samuel said to Jesʹse : “ Jehovah has not chosen any of these . ”

16 There was constant warfare between Aʹsa and Baʹa·sha the king of Israel . 17 So King Baʹa·sha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up Raʹmah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Aʹsa of Judah . 18 At that Aʹsa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the treasuries of the house of the king and handed them over to his servants . King Aʹsa then sent them to Ben-haʹdad the son of Tab·rimʹmon the son of Heʹzi·on , the king of Syria , who was dwelling in Damascus , saying : 19 “ There is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father . I am sending you a gift of silver and gold . Come , break your treaty with King Baʹa·sha of Israel , so that he will withdraw from me . ” 20 Ben-haʹdad listened to King Aʹsa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel , and they struck down Iʹjon , Dan , Aʹbel-beth-maʹa·cah , all Chinʹne·reth , and all the land of Naphʹta·li . 21 When Baʹa·sha heard of it , he immediately quit building Raʹmah and continued dwelling in Tirʹzah . 22 King Aʹsa then summoned all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried off the stones and timbers of Raʹmah that Baʹa·sha had been building with , and with them King Aʹsa built up Geʹba in Benjamin , and Mizʹpah .

13 Then all the assembly sent a message to the Benʹja·min·ites on the crag of Rimʹmon and offered them peace . 14 So Benjamin came back at that time . They gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad , but they did not find enough for them . 15 And the people felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin because Jehovah had made a division among the tribes of Israel . 16 The elders of the assembly said : “ What should we do to provide wives for the remaining men , since all the women were annihilated out of Benjamin ? ” 17 They replied : “ There should be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin , so that a tribe may not be wiped out of Israel . 18 But we are not allowed to give them wives from our daughters , because the people of Israel have sworn : ‘ Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin . ’ ”

It will be a place for their houses and a sacred place for the sanctuary .

At the same time , extremes in rewording the text must be avoided . A translator who liberally paraphrases the Bible according to how he interprets the overall idea could distort the meaning of the text . How so ? The translator may erroneously insert his opinion of what the original text means or may omit important details contained in the original text . So while paraphrases of the Bible may be easy to read , their very freeness at times may prevent the reader from getting the true message of the text .

17 The preaching work is very urgent . We should “ preach the word , ” and we should “ be at it urgently . ” ( 2 Timothy 4 :2 ) People need to hear about God ’ s Kingdom . The Bible says : “ The great day of Jehovah is near ! It is near and it is approaching very quickly ! ” The end “ will not be late ! ” ( Zephaniah 1 :14 ; Habakkuk 2 :3 ) Yes , very soon , Jehovah will destroy Satan ’ s wicked world . Before that happens , people need to be warned so that they can choose to serve Jehovah .
But the righteous one is a foundation forever .
6 There is a danger that we could miss out on some benefits because we assume that certain spiritual provisions do not apply to us . For example , what if a portion of the Bible does not seem relevant to our situation ? Or what if we are not part of the primary audience for a certain publication ? Do we tend to give such information superficial consideration or even skip it altogether ? If so , we could be depriving ourselves of information that would be of great benefit to us . How can we avoid falling into that trap ? Above all , each one of us should bear in mind that God is the Source of our spiritual provisions . Through the prophet Isaiah , he said : “ I , Jehovah , am your God , the One teaching you to benefit yourself . ” ( Isa . 48 :17 ) It will be helpful to consider three suggestions for benefiting from all portions of the Bible and the various types of spiritual food available to us .

9 As soon as Solʹo·mon had finished building the house of Jehovah , the house of the king , and everything Solʹo·mon desired to make , 2 Jehovah appeared to Solʹo·mon a second time , just as he had appeared to him in Gibʹe·on . 3 Jehovah said to him : “ I have heard your prayer and your request for favor that you made before me . I have sanctified this house that you built by permanently putting my name there , and my eyes and my heart will always be there . 4 And you , if you walk before me as your father David walked , with integrity of heart and with uprightness , by doing everything I have commanded you , and you obey my regulations and my judgments , 5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , just as I promised your father David , saying , ‘ There will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of Israel . ’ 6 But if you and your sons turn away from following me and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have put before you , and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them , 7 I will cut Israel off from the surface of the land that I have given to them , and the house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight , and Israel will become an object of scorn and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples . 8 And this house will become heaps of ruins . Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will whistle and say , ‘ Why did Jehovah do that to this land and this house ? ’ 9 Then they will say , ‘ It was because they abandoned Jehovah their God , who had brought their forefathers out of the land of Egypt , and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them . That is why Jehovah brought all this calamity on them . ’ ”

7 Cutting short the days . Our King revealed what will occur at this point during the great tribulation . Jesus stated : “ On account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short . ” ( Read Matthew 24 :21 , 22 . ) Jesus ’ words were fulfilled on a small scale in 66 C .E . when Jehovah “ cut short ” the Roman army ’ s attack on Jerusalem . ( Mark 13 :20 ) That action allowed Christians in Jerusalem and Judea to be saved . What will then happen on a global scale during the coming great tribulation ? Jehovah , by means of our King , will “ cut short ” the United Nations ’ attack on religion so that the true religion will not be destroyed with the false . Thus , while all false religious organizations will be torn down , the one true religion will survive . ( Ps . 96 :5 ) Let us now consider what events will occur after this part of the great tribulation has passed .
5 “ Hear this word that I am taking up against you as a dirge , O house of Israel :
5 Of course , the merchants returned . About three years later , Jesus addressed the same injustice , this time quoting Jehovah ’ s own words condemning those who made His house “ a cave of robbers . ” ( Matthew 21 :13 ; Jeremiah 7 :11 ) Yes , when Jesus saw the greedy exploitation of the people and the defilement of God ’ s temple , he felt just as his Father did . And no wonder ! For countless millions of years , Jesus had been taught by his heavenly Father . As a result , he was imbued with Jehovah ’ s sense of justice . He became a living illustration of the saying , “ Like father , like son . ” So if we want to obtain a clear picture of Jehovah ’ s quality of justice , we can do no better than ponder the example of Jesus Christ .—John 14 :9 , 10 .

We want to make sure that we allow God ’ s Word to reach our heart and strengthen our faith .

5 But what happened ? Motivated by selfish ambition , an angel misused his free will and became Satan , which means “ Resister . ” He deceived Eve by assuring her of something contrary to God ’ s will . ( Genesis 3 :4 , 5 ) Adam joined Eve in breaking God ’ s law . By grasping for what did not belong to them , they lost their glorious freedom . Sin became their master , and as God had warned , death eventually followed . The inheritance they passed on to their offspring was sin—manifest in an inborn tendency toward wrongdoing . Sin also brought weaknesses resulting in disease , aging , and death . The inclination toward wrongdoing , aggravated by Satanic influence , produced a human society with a history of hatreds , crimes , oppression , and wars that have taken many millions of lives . What a contrast to the freedom that God gave mankind at the beginning ! —Deuteronomy 32 :4 , 5 ; Job 14 :1 , 2 ; Romans 5 :12 ; Revelation 12 :9 .

Pioneering was teaching me to lean on Jehovah , and I began to feel more comfortable with the idea of serving overseas . Also , I was invited by a single sister who had served as a missionary in Japan for over 30 years to go on a witnessing trip to Japan for three months . Working alongside her fueled my desire to move abroad . ” In the mid-1980 ’ s , Wendy moved to Vanuatu , an island nation about 1 ,100 miles ( 1 ,770 km ) east of Australia .

12 A popular philosophy or common adage is : Follow your heart . But doing that can be dangerous . And in a sense , doing so is unscriptural . The Bible warns us not to let our imperfect heart or mere sentiment rule when we are making decisions . ( Prov . 28 :26 ) And Bible accounts show the sad consequences of following one ’ s heart . The core problem is that in imperfect humans , “ the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate . ” ( Jer . 3 :17 ; 13 :10 ; 17 :9 ; 1 Ki . 11 :9 ) So , what could it mean for us if we simply follow our heart ?

For a while , the apostle Peter harbored prejudice against non-Jews , but he gradually learned to eradicate negative views from his heart . ( Acts 10 :28 , 34 , 35 ; Gal . 2 :11-14 ) Likewise , if we detect any trace of prejudice or racial pride in us , we should make a conscious effort to root it out of our heart . ( 1 Pet . 1 :22 ) We might reflect on the fact that none of us deserve salvation ; we are all imperfect humans , regardless of our nationality . ( Rom . 3 :9 , 10 , 21-24 ) So why should we feel superior to anyone else ? We should have a view like that of the apostle Paul , who admonished his fellow anointed Christians that they were “ no longer strangers and foreigners , but . . . members of the household of God . ” ( Eph . 2 :19 ) Earnest effort to overcome prejudiced views regarding those who are of a different background will certainly help us to put on the new personality .—Col . 3 :10 , 11 . w16 .10 1 :9

( 1 John 3 :23 , 24 ) It causes us to rejoice that Jehovah has kindly given to his Son “ the name that is above every other name [ except God ’ s name ] , so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground , and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father . ” —Philippians 2 :9-11 .

As part of their Gilead training , the 124th class spent a combined total of some 3 ,000 hours in the preaching work .

These encouraging experiences were followed by interviews , chaired by Patrick LaFranca of the United States Branch Committee , with Gilead graduates now serving in various lands .

He continued conversing for quite a while , until daybreak , and then he departed . 12 So they took the boy away alive and were comforted beyond measure .

14 Jehovah looks beyond our imperfections and sees our potential . To illustrate : People who love works of art will go to great lengths to restore badly damaged paintings or other works . When , for example , in the National Gallery in London , England , someone with a shotgun damaged a Leonardo da Vinci drawing worth some $ 30 million , no one suggested that since the drawing was now damaged , it should be discarded . Work to restore the nearly 500-year-old masterpiece began immediately . Why ? Because it was precious in the eyes of art lovers . Are you not worth more than a chalk and charcoal drawing ? In God ’ s eyes you certainly are—however damaged you may be by inherited imperfection . ( Psalm 72 :12-14 ) Jehovah God , the skilled Creator of the human family , will do what is necessary to restore to perfection all of those who respond to his loving care .—Acts 3 :21 ; Romans 8 :20-22 .
I became an object of scorn to them .
6 One of the first things such an examination reveals is that this Messianic Kingdom is an expression of Jehovah ’ s own sovereignty . It was Jehovah who gave “ rulership and dignity and kingdom ” to his Son . After God ’ s Son was empowered to begin ruling as King , voices in heaven appropriately declared : “ The kingdom of the world did become the kingdom of our Lord [ Jehovah God ] and of his Christ , and he [ Jehovah ] will rule as king forever and ever . ” ( Revelation 11 :15 ) So everything that we observe about this Kingdom and what it accomplishes can draw us closer to Jehovah himself . What we learn should instill in us a desire to submit to his sovereignty forever .

15 We try hard to keep healthy , but because life is precious to God , we will not accept a blood transfusion . It is more important to obey Jehovah than to try to extend our life by disobeying him . Jesus said : “ Whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it . ” ( Matthew 16 :25 ) We want to obey Jehovah because we love him . He knows what is best for us , and we view life as precious and holy , as Jehovah does .—Hebrews 11 :6 .

9 Anyone can act immodestly if he allows himself temporarily to be overcome by fleshly desires . Selfish ambition , envy , and uncontrolled anger have led many to presumptuous acts . Bible characters like Absalom , Uzziah , and Nebuchadnezzar succumbed to such works of the flesh and were humbled by Jehovah for their presumptuousness .—2 Sam . 15 :1-6 ; 18 :9-17 ; 2 Chron . 26 :16-21 ; Dan . 5 :18-21 .

14 And as soon as the king of Aʹi saw this , he and the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the desert plain . But he did not know that there was an ambush set against him to the rear of the city . 15 When the men of Aʹi attacked , Joshua and all Israel fled along the road in the direction of the wilderness . 16 Then all the people who were in the city were summoned to pursue them ; and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city . 17 Not a man was remaining in Aʹi and Bethʹel who did not go out after Israel . They left the city wide open and pursued Israel .

He will not desert you or bring you to ruin or forget the covenant that he swore to your forefathers .

4 In addition to publications for Jehovah ’ s Witnesses in general , we receive Bible-based material that appeals to specific groups . Some material is especially designed to help young people ; other material assists their parents . Much of the material in print and on our website is prepared with the non-Witness public in mind . Such an abundance of spiritual food reminds us that Jehovah has kept his promise to “ make for all the peoples a banquet of rich dishes . ” —Isa . 25 :6 .
7 However , most people who celebrate Christmas today are not thinking of its pagan origins . They simply look forward to Christmas as a time to be with family , enjoy good food , and give gifts . Of course , we love our family and friends , and Jehovah wants his servants to share with one another . As 2 Corinthians 9 :7 tells us , “ God loves a cheerful giver . ” Jehovah does not want us to give to others only on special occasions . Jehovah ’ s people enjoy giving gifts and getting together with friends and family at any time of the year , without expecting anything in return . They give because they love others .—Luke 14 :12-14 .
22 So the messenger went and told David everything that Joʹab had sent him to tell . 23 Then the messenger told David : “ Their men overpowered us , and they came out against us in the field ; but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate . 24 And the archers were shooting at your servants from the top of the wall , and some of the servants of the king died ; your servant U·riʹah the Hitʹtite also died . ” 25 At that David said to the messenger : “ Say this to Joʹab : ‘ Do not let this matter trouble you , for the sword devours one as well as another . Intensify your battle against the city and conquer it . ’ And encourage him . ”
For we trust in his holy name .
By denying that Jesus expels demons with God ’ s power , the scribes and Pharisees are at risk of blaspheming the holy spirit . Hence , whose side will they take—God ’ s or Satan ’ s ? Jesus says : “ Either you make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten , for by its fruit the tree is known . ” —Matthew 12 :33 .
And help to glorify his holy name .

23 How refreshing to know that our God is “ ready to forgive ” ! Despite the mistakes we may have made , we should never conclude that we are beyond the reach of Jehovah ’ s mercy . If we truly repent , take steps to right the wrong , and earnestly pray for forgiveness on the basis of Jesus ’ shed blood , we can have full confidence that Jehovah will forgive us . ( 1 John 1 :9 ) Let us imitate his forgiveness in our dealings with one another . After all , if Jehovah , who does not sin , can so lovingly forgive us , should not we sinful humans do our best to forgive one another ?
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements .

From the larger group you will take many , and from the smaller group you will take few . Each group will give some of its cities to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance that it receives . ”

Rabbinic rules stated that no one should come within four cubits ( about six feet ) ( 1 .8 m ) of a leper . But if a wind was blowing , the leper had to be kept at least 100 cubits ( about 150 feet ) ( 45 m ) away . The Midrash Rabbah tells of one rabbi who hid from lepers and of another who threw stones at lepers to keep them away . Lepers thus knew the pain of rejection and the feeling of being despised and unwanted .

20 In God ’ s eyes , Satan ’ s entire world is bloodguilty . Its political systems , portrayed in the Scriptures as vicious beasts , have slaughtered countless millions , including many of Jehovah ’ s servants . ( Daniel 8 :3 , 4 , 20-22 ; Revelation 13 :1 , 2 , 7 , 8 ) Hand in hand with these beastlike powers , business and science have worked to create some of the most heinous weapons imaginable , making huge profits in the process .

4 How do we benefit from understanding the significance of this prophecy ? Paul states : “ You are not in darkness , so that the day should overtake you as it would thieves . ” ( 1 Thess . 5 :3 , 4 ) Unlike people in general , we discern where current events are heading . In exactly what manner will this prophecy about peace and security be fulfilled ? We must wait and see how the world scene develops . Therefore , “ let us stay awake and keep our senses . ” —1 Thess . 5 :6 ; Zeph . 3 :8 .

15 In the congregation , you can find people who truly love Jehovah . They can become your close friends . ( Psalm 133 :1 ) Don ’ t look for friends only among people of your own age or background . Remember that Jonathan was much older than David , and Ruth was much younger than Naomi . We want to follow the Bible ’ s advice : “ Open your hearts wide . ” ( 2 Corinthians 6 :13 ; read 1 Peter 2 :17 . ) And the more you imitate Jehovah , the more others will want to be your friend .

22 And Joseph continued to dwell in Egypt , he and the household of his father , and Joseph lived for 110 years . 23 Joseph saw the third generation of Eʹphra·im ’ s sons , also the sons of Maʹchir , Ma·nasʹseh ’ s son . They were born upon Joseph ’ s knees . 24 At length Joseph said to his brothers : “ I am dying , but God will without fail turn his attention to you , and he will certainly bring you up out of this land to the land about which he swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . ” 25 So Joseph made the sons of Israel swear , saying : “ God will without fail turn his attention to you . You must take my bones up out of here . ” 26 And Joseph died at the age of 110 , and they had him embalmed , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .

11 Finally Samuel said to Jesʹse : “ Are these all of your boys ? ” To this he said : “ The youngest has been left out until now ; he is pasturing the sheep . ” Then Samuel said to Jesʹse : “ Send for him , because we will not sit down for the meal until he comes here . ” 12 So he sent for him and brought him in . Now he was ruddy , with beautiful eyes , and handsome in appearance . Then Jehovah said : “ Get up , anoint him , for this is the one ! ” 13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers . And the spirit of Jehovah began to empower David from that day forward . Samuel later rose and went his way to Raʹmah .
4 Another reason to serve Jehovah is found in the words of the Israelite leader Joshua . Near the end of his life , Joshua told God ’ s people : “ You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed . They have all come true for you . ” Why could Joshua say this ? —Josh . 23 :14 .

Why is it only right that we obey Jehovah ? —Revelation 4 :11 .
The word “ one ” suggests unity and oneness of purpose and activity . Jehovah God is not divided or unpredictable . Rather , he is always faithful , consistent , loyal , and true . He promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the Promised Land , and Jehovah performed mighty deeds to fulfill that promise . The passing of 430 years did not diminish Jehovah ’ s determination to do so . ( Gen . 12 :1 , 2 , 7 ; Ex . 12 :40 , 41 ) Centuries later , when identifying the Israelites as his witnesses , Jehovah told them : “ I am the same One . Before me no God was formed , and after me there has been none . ” Emphasizing his unchanging purpose , Jehovah added : “ I am always the same One . ” ( Isa . 43 :10 , 13 ; 44 :6 ; 48 :12 ) What an extraordinary privilege for the Israelites—and for us—to be servants of Jehovah , the God who is consistent and loyal in all his ways ! —Mal . 3 :6 ; Jas . 1 :17 . w16 .06 3 :6 , 7

This you have said truthfully . ” 19 The woman said to him : “ Sir , I see that you are a prophet . 20 Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain , but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship . ” 21 Jesus said to her : “ Believe me , woman , the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father . 22 You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we know , because salvation begins with the Jews . 23 Nevertheless , the hour is coming , and it is now , when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth , for indeed , the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him . 24 God is a Spirit , and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth . ” 25 The woman said to him : “ I know that Mes·siʹah is coming , who is called Christ . Whenever that one comes , he will declare all things to us openly . ” 26 Jesus said to her : “ I am he , the one speaking to you . ”

You are to bury me in my burial place , which I have excavated in the land of Caʹnaan . ” Please , let me go up and bury my father , after which I will return . ’ ” 6 Pharʹaoh replied : “ Go and bury your father just as he made you swear . ”
3 “ From the 13th year of Jo·siʹah son of Aʹmon , the king of Judah , to this day , these 23 years , the word of Jehovah has come to me , and I kept speaking to you again and again , but you would not listen . 4 And Jehovah sent all his servants the prophets to you , sending them again and again , but you would not listen or incline your ear to hear . 5 They would say , ‘ Turn back , please , each of you from your evil ways and your evil deeds ; then you will continue dwelling for a long time to come in the land that Jehovah long ago gave to you and to your forefathers . 6 Do not follow other gods and serve them and bow down to them , offending me with the work of your hands ; otherwise I will bring calamity on you . ’

And to that end stay awake , constantly making supplication in behalf of all the holy ones . 19 Pray also for me , that the words may be given to me when I open my mouth , so that I may be able to speak boldly in making known the sacred secret of the good news , 20 for which I am acting as an ambassador in chains , and that I may speak about it with boldness , as I ought to speak .

3 Beloved ones , this is now the second letter I am writing you in which , as in my first one , I am stirring up your clear thinking faculties by way of a reminder , 2 that you should remember the sayings previously spoken by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles . 3 First of all know this , that in the last days ridiculers will come with their ridicule , proceeding according to their own desires 4 and saying : “ Where is this promised presence of his ? Why , from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death , all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation ’ s beginning . ”
Scholars disagree as to what language Jesus spoke . However , as a man on earth , it appears that Jesus could well have used a form of Hebrew and a dialect of Aramaic . When Jesus came to Nazareth in Galilee and entered the synagogue there , he read from the prophecy of Isaiah , evidently as written in Hebrew . Nothing is said about Jesus ’ translating this passage into Aramaic .—Luke 4 :16-21 .

5 In time all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebʹron and said : “ Look ! We are your own bone and flesh . 2 In times past while Saul was our king , you were the one who was leading Israel on its campaigns . And Jehovah said to you : ‘ You will shepherd my people Israel , and you will become leader over Israel . ’ ” 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebʹron , and King David made a covenant with them in Hebʹron before Jehovah . Then they anointed David as king over Israel .

6 Are you a young person ? If so , the account about young Samuel shows that Jehovah understands the challenges you face and how you feel . Perhaps you are shy and find it hard to share the Kingdom message with adults or to stand out as different among your peers . Be assured that Jehovah wants to help you . So pour out your heart to him in prayer . ( Ps . 62 :8 ) Reflect on Bible examples of such young ones as Samuel . And talk with fellow Christians—young or old—who may have overcome challenges like those you are facing . Indeed , they may tell you about times when Jehovah came to their aid , perhaps in ways that they had not expected .

Pray for “ power beyond what is normal , ” and force your mind to focus on other matters .—2 Corinthians 4 :7 ; 1 Corinthians 9 :27 ; see the box “ How Can I Break a Bad Habit ? ”
14 After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hez·e·kiʹah and asked him : “ What did these men say , and where did they come from ? ” So Hez·e·kiʹah said : “ They came from a distant land , from Babylon . ” 15 Next he asked : “ What did they see in your house ? ” Hez·e·kiʹah replied : “ They saw everything in my house . There was nothing that I did not show them in my treasuries . ”

We always had a regular family study , during which we would act out situations that could happen at school . We would have the girls play the part of a Witness answering questions . They had fun learning in this way , and it gave them confidence . As they got older , they complained at times about having the family study . Once , in desperation , I told them to go to their rooms and that we would not have the study . They were shocked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study . Then we began to realize that we really were instilling appreciation for spiritual matters in their young hearts . They grew to love the study , and we allowed them to express themselves freely . It was hard at times , though , to hear them say that they did not agree with some aspect of the truth . Yet , we learned what was really in their hearts . After we reasoned with them , they would be satisfied with Jehovah ’ s thinking on matters .

15 Do not wickedly lie in ambush near the home of the righteous one ;
Of course , when it comes to exercising patience , Jehovah is the most outstanding example for us to follow . ( 2 Pet . 3 :15 ) There are many accounts in God ’ s Word of times when Jehovah displayed great patience . ( Neh . 9 :30 ; Isa . 30 :18 ) For instance , how did Jehovah react when Abraham questioned His decision to destroy Sodom ? First of all , Jehovah did not interrupt as Abraham spoke . Instead , Jehovah listened patiently to each of Abraham ’ s questions and concerns . Then , Jehovah showed that he had listened as he repeated Abraham ’ s concerns and assured him that He would not destroy Sodom even if just ten righteous men were found in that city . ( Gen . 18 :22-33 ) What a fine example of patient listening and of not overreacting !

The crowds marvel at this , saying : “ Never has anything like this been seen in Israel . ” Pharisees are also present .

In this time of the end , Jehovah ’ s people have been commissioned to preach “ this good news of the Kingdom . . . in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations . ” ( Matt . 24 :14 ) The message we spread is also “ the good news of the undeserved kindness of God ” because all the blessings we hope to receive under Kingdom rule come to us through Jehovah ’ s kindness expressed by means of Christ . ( Acts 20 :24 ; Eph . 1 :3 ) Do we individually imitate Paul in showing gratitude for Jehovah ’ s undeserved kindness by zealously sharing in the ministry ? ( Rom . 1 :14 , 15 ) As sinners , we benefit from Jehovah ’ s undeserved kindness in many ways . We therefore owe it to all people to do our utmost to make known to them how Jehovah is expressing his love and how they can benefit from it personally . w16 .07 4 :4 , 5

What a lesson that should teach us about forgiveness ! God has forgiven us a large debt of sin . Whatever transgression a Christian brother commits against us is small in comparison . And Jehovah forgives us not once but thousands of times . Can we not forgive our brother a number of times , even if we have a cause for complaint ? As Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount , God will “ forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . ” —Matthew 6 :12 .
The government uses the money it gets from taxes to pay for things .
21 Of course , none of these manifestations of Jehovah ’ s humility—his mildness , his willingness to listen , his patience , his reasonableness—mean that Jehovah compromises his righteous principles . The clergy of Christendom may think that they are being reasonable when they tickle the ears of their flocks by watering down Jehovah ’ s moral standards . ( 2 Timothy 4 :3 ) But the human tendency to compromise for the sake of expediency has nothing to do with divine reasonableness . Jehovah is holy ; never will he pollute his righteous standards . ( Leviticus 11 :44 ) Let us , then , love Jehovah ’ s reasonableness for what it is—a proof of his humility . Do you not thrill to think that Jehovah God , the wisest Being in the universe , is also sublimely humble ? What a delight to draw close to this awesome yet mild , patient , reasonable God !

6 If the blood of a slaughtered animal was not used on the altar , it was to be poured out on the ground . Thus , in a symbolic way , the life was returned to its original Owner . ( Deuteronomy 12 :16 ; Ezekiel 18 :4 ) Note , though , that the Israelites did not have to go to extremes in trying to remove every trace of blood from the animal ’ s tissues . Provided that the creature was properly slaughtered and bled , an Israelite could eat it with a clear conscience , as due respect would have been accorded to the Life-Giver .

12 When Ath·a·liʹah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king , she immediately came to the people at the house of Jehovah . 13 Then she saw the king standing there by his pillar at the entrance . The princes and the trumpeters were with the king , and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets , and the singers with musical instruments were leading the praises . At this Ath·a·liʹah ripped her garments apart and cried out : “ Conspiracy ! Conspiracy ! ” 14 But Je·hoiʹa·da the priest brought out the chiefs of hundreds , those appointed over the army , and said to them : “ Take her out from among the ranks , and if anyone follows her , put him to death with the sword ! ” For the priest had said : “ Do not put her to death in the house of Jehovah . ” 15 So they seized her , and when she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king ’ s house , they immediately put her to death there .

This man is a guest in the house of Simon , a tanner , by the sea . ’ 33 I then sent for you at once , and you were kind enough to come here .

6 In fact , restoration was a recurring theme in the writings of the Hebrew prophets . Through them , Jehovah promised a land restored and repopulated , fertile , protected from wild beasts and enemy attack . He described their restored land as a veritable paradise ! ( Isaiah 65 :25 ; Ezekiel 34 :25 ; 36 :35 ) Above all , pure worship would be reestablished , and the temple would be rebuilt . ( Micah 4 :1-5 ) These prophecies gave the exiled Jews hope , helping them to endure their 70-year captivity in Babylon .

In order to counterbalance the sin of Adam , Jesus had to die , not as a perfect child , but as a perfect man . Remember , Adam ’ s sin was willful , carried out with full knowledge of the seriousness of the act and its consequences . So in order to become “ the last Adam ” and cover that sin , Jesus had to make a mature , knowing choice to keep his integrity to Jehovah . ( 1 Corinthians 15 :45 , 47 ) Thus Jesus ’ entire faithful life course—including his sacrificial death—served as “ one act of justification . ” —Romans 5 :18 , 19 .

( Ex . 22 :28 ; Lev . 19 :32 ) Can you imagine Samuel going up to Eli in the morning and boldly telling him God ’ s stinging judgment message ? Of course not ! Indeed , the account tells us that Samuel “ was afraid to tell Eli of the vision . ” However , God made clear to Eli that He was calling Samuel . As a result , Eli took charge of the situation and told Samuel to speak . “ [ Do not ] hide from me a single word of all that he said to you , ” Eli commanded . Samuel obediently “ told him everything . ”

Because everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated , but whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”

9 Such teaching places an important obligation on parents . The apostle Paul asked : “ Do you , however , the one teaching someone else , not teach yourself ? You , the one preaching , ‘ Do not steal , ’ do you steal ? ” ( Romans 2 :21 ) Some parents confuse their children by teaching about honesty while acting dishonestly themselves . They may justify petty theft and deceptive words with such excuses as “ Oh , they expect people to take these things ” or “ That was just a little white lie , a fib . ” In reality , stealing is stealing , regardless of the value of the item stolen , and lying is lying , regardless of the subject matter or the scope of the untruth . ( Read Luke 16 :10 . ) Children are quick to detect hypocrisy and may be seriously damaged by it . ( Ephesians 6 :4 ) However , when they learn honesty from their parents ’ examples , they may well grow up to glorify Jehovah in this dishonest world .—Proverbs 22 :6 .

JESUS stood before Pilate , the Jewish nation ’ s most powerful secular judge , and stated a principle that has guided His genuine followers down to our day . “ My Kingdom is no part of this world , ” he said . “ If my Kingdom were part of this world , my attendants would have fought that I should not be handed over to the Jews . But as it is , my Kingdom is not from this source . ” ( John 18 :36 ) Pilate had Jesus executed , but the victory was short-lived . Jesus was resurrected . Emperors of the mighty Roman Empire tried to crush Christ ’ s followers , but their efforts were futile . Christians spread the Kingdom message throughout the ancient world .—Col . 1 :23 .

16 Think of the apostle Paul . We can be sure that he was not sharing in the gross wrongs mentioned at 1 Corinthians 6 :9-11 . Nonetheless , he confessed that he was still guilty of sin . He wrote : “ I am fleshly , sold under sin . For I do not understand what I am doing . For I do not practice what I wish , but I do what I hate . ” ( Rom . 7 :14 , 15 ) This shows that there were other things that Paul viewed as sins , and he was fighting against those wrongs too . ( Read Romans 7 :21-23 . ) May that also be true of us as we strive to be “ obedient from the heart . ”

15 Thus far we have seen that true Christians came into Babylonian captivity soon after the death of the last of the apostles . However , a number of questions arise : What additional evidence is there that in the decades leading up to 1914 , the anointed were actually breaking free from Babylon the Great , no longer being enslaved by her ? Is it true that Jehovah was displeased with his servants because they had slowed down in their preaching activity during World War I ? And did some of our brothers during that period compromise their Christian neutrality and thereby incur Jehovah ’ s displeasure ? Finally , if Christians went into bondage to false religion from the second century C .E . onward , when did they get freed ? Excellent questions these . They will be answered in the next article .

18 After his sacrificial death , Jesus was resurrected to heaven where he was given more work to do with authority “ far above every government and authority and power and lordship . ” ( Eph . 1 :19-21 ) If we die faithful before Armageddon , we will be resurrected into a righteous new world , where there will be plenty of satisfying work for us to do . Now , though , there is vitally important work that all of us can participate in—preaching the good news and making disciples . May all of us , young or old , keep on “ having plenty to do in the work of the Lord . ” —1 Cor . 15 :58 .
32 Their settlements were Eʹtam , Aʹin , Rimʹmon , Toʹchen , and Aʹshan , five cities , 33 along with their settlements that were all around these cities as far as Baʹal .

10 In acknowledging that they too were imperfect , Paul and Barnabas were not saying that their way of worship was basically the same as that of those pagans . Were the two of them not missionaries with a special appointment ? ( Acts 13 :2 ) Had they not been anointed with holy spirit and clothed with a glorious hope ? Yes , but Paul and Barnabas understood that the Lycaonian people could receive the same advantages if they responded favorably to the good news .
46 “ For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says : ‘ An army will be brought against them to make them an object of horror and something to plunder . 47 The army will hurl stones at them and cut them down with their swords . They will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire . 48 I will put an end to the obscene conduct in the land , and all the women will learn a lesson and not copy your obscene conduct . 49 They will bring on you the consequences of your obscene conduct and of your sins with your disgusting idols ; and you will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah . ’ ”

5 Because we could never grasp the full extent of his power , Jehovah uses illustrations to help us . As we have seen , he uses the bull to symbolize his power . ( Ezekiel 1 :4-10 ) That choice is apt , for even the domesticated bull is a huge and powerful creature . People in the Palestine of Bible times rarely , if ever , faced anything stronger . But they did know of a more fearsome sort of bull—the wild bull , or aurochs , which has since become extinct . ( Job 39 :9-12 ) Roman Emperor Julius Caesar once observed that these bulls were scarcely smaller than elephants . “ Great is their strength , ” he wrote , “ and great their speed . ” Imagine how tiny and weak you would feel standing in the shadow of such a creature !

5 Later on Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac , 6 but Abraham gave gifts to his sons by his concubines . Then while he was still alive , he sent them eastward , away from Isaac his son , to the land of the East . 7 The years of Abraham ’ s life were 175 years . 8 Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age , old and satisfied , and was gathered to his people . 9 His sons Isaac and Ishʹma·el buried him in the cave of Mach·peʹlah in the field of Eʹphron the son of Zoʹhar the Hitʹtite that is in front of Mamʹre , 10 the field that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth . There Abraham was buried , with his wife Sarah . 11 After Abraham ’ s death , God continued to bless his son Isaac , and Isaac was dwelling near Beʹer-laʹhai-roi .

5 In years gone by , we believed that Jehovah became displeased with his people because they did not have a zealous share in the preaching work during World War I . We concluded that for this reason , Jehovah allowed Babylon the Great to take them captive for a short time . However , faithful brothers and sisters who served God during the 1914-1918 period later made it clear that as a whole the Lord ’ s people did everything they could to keep the preaching work going . There is strong evidence to support this testimony . A more accurate understanding of our theocratic history has led to a clearer comprehension of certain events recorded in the Bible .
Strong though they appear .
4 Thousands of years later , Jehovah gave the people of Israel laws to help them to serve him acceptably . Because these laws were given through the prophet Moses , they are sometimes called the Mosaic Law . Part of the Mosaic Law said : “ You must not murder . ” ( Deuteronomy 5 :17 ) This showed the Israelites that God values human life and that people must value the lives of others .

So I warned them against selling provisions on that day . 16 And the Tyrʹi·ans who lived in the city were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise , selling them to the people of Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath . 17 So I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them : “ What is this evil thing that you are doing , even profaning the Sabbath day ? 18 Was not this what your forefathers did , so that our God brought all this disaster on us and also on this city ? Now you are adding to the burning anger against Israel by profaning the Sabbath . ”

13 E·liʹsha said to the king of Israel : “ What do I have to do with you ? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother . ” But the king of Israel said to him : “ No , for it is Jehovah who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moʹab . ” 14 To this E·liʹsha said : “ As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve is living , if I did not have regard for King Je·hoshʹa·phat of Judah , I would not look at you or take notice of you . 15 Now bring me a harpist . ” As soon as the harpist started playing , the hand of Jehovah came on him . 16 He said , “ This is what Jehovah says : ‘ Dig trench after trench in this valley , 17 for this is what Jehovah says : “ You will not see wind , and you will not see rain ; yet this valley will be filled with water , and you will drink from it , you , your livestock , and your other animals . ” ’ 18 But this is a trivial thing in the eyes of Jehovah , for he will also give Moʹab into your hand . 19 You must strike down every fortified city and every choice city , you should cut down every good tree , you should stop up all the springs of water , and you should ruin every good plot of land with stones . ”

What bold stand did the early Bible Students take relative to Babylon the Great ?
3 However , Romans chapter 8 is also of interest to those who have the earthly hope because God in a sense views them as righteous . We see an indication of that in what Paul wrote earlier in his letter . In chapter 4 , he discussed Abraham . That man of faith lived before Jehovah gave the Law to Israel and long before Jesus died for our sins . Still , Jehovah noted Abraham ’ s outstanding faith and counted him as righteous . ( Read Romans 4 :20-22 . ) Jehovah can in a similar way consider as righteous the faithful Christians today who have the Bible-based hope of living forever on earth . Accordingly , they can benefit from the counsel found in Romans chapter 8 that is given to righteous ones .

3 Water baptism is a step that true Christians undertake in symbol of their unreserved dedication to Jehovah God . That is so of those who received the heavenly calling . But water baptism is also a necessary step for millions of men and women in modern times who now have the hope of living forever on earth . Regardless of a person ’ s hope , being baptized in water in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit is a necessary step that one must take in order to be acceptable to God . All Christians who are thus baptized are expected to “ keep walking by spirit . ” ( Read Galatians 5 :16 . ) Are you walking by spirit and thus living up to your dedication ?

He has been thrown out of heaven , and he knows he will be destroyed very soon . He does everything he can to cause trouble , pain , and suffering all over the earth .
8 During the first world war , no effort was spared to keep providing spiritual food and encouragement to the scattered Bible Students . These provisions gave the brothers the strength to carry on the preaching work . Richard H . Barber , who was active during that time , recalled : “ We succeeded in keeping a few traveling overseers going and in keeping The Watch Tower in circulation and having it sent into Canada where it was banned . I had the privilege of mailing pocket-size copies of The Finished Mystery to a number of friends who had lost their copy due to confiscation . Brother Rutherford requested that we arrange conventions in several cities in the western United States and send speakers to try to encourage the friends as much as possible . ”

13 How long should our prayers be ? The Bible does not place any limit on how long private or public prayers should be . They may range from a brief prayer before a meal to a long private prayer in which we pour out our heart to Jehovah . ( 1 Samuel 1 :12 , 15 ) However , Jesus condemned self-righteous individuals who made long , showy prayers before others . ( Luke 20 :46 , 47 ) Such prayers do not impress Jehovah . What is important is that we pray from our heart . Hence , the length of acceptable prayers may vary according to needs and circumstances .

He is saying : “ What should I do about my son ? ” ’ 3 Go on from there until you come to the big tree of Taʹbor , where you will meet three men going up to the true God at Bethʹel , one carrying three young goats , one carrying three loaves of bread , and one carrying a large jar of wine . 4 They will ask about your welfare and give you two loaves , and you must accept the loaves from them . 5 After that you will come to the hill of the true God , where there is a garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines . When you come to the city , you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place , and a stringed instrument and tambourine and flute and harp will be played ahead of them while they are prophesying . 6 The spirit of Jehovah will empower you , and you will prophesy along with them and be changed into a different person . 7 When these signs have taken place , do whatever your hand finds possible , because the true God is with you . 8 Then go down ahead of me to Gilʹgal , and I will go down to you there to offer up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices . You should wait for seven days until I come to you . Then I will let you know what you should do . ”
35 As they were emptying their sacks , here was each one ’ s bag of money in his sack . When they and their father saw their bags of money , they became afraid . 36 Jacob their father exclaimed to them : “ It is I you have bereaved ! Joseph is no more , and Simʹe·on is no more , and you are going to take Benjamin ! It is upon me that all these things have come ! ” 37 But Reuʹben said to his father : “ You may put to death my own two sons if I do not bring him back to you . Give him over to my care , and I will return him to you . ” 38 However , he said : “ My son will not go down with you , because his brother is dead and he alone is left . If a fatal accident should befall him on the journey you would make , then you would certainly bring down my gray hairs to the Grave in grief . ”

Let us do it with a joyful heart . ” Note how the brothers grasped the same two important facts about the preaching work that Jesus had impressed upon his apostles : The work is urgent , and the workers are joyful .

( Acts 15 :28 , 29 ; Gal . 4 :9-11 ) Yet , Paul and other Christians did not speak disrespectfully of the Law ; they were able to witness in many Jewish communities without interference . ( 1 Cor . 9 :20 ) In fact , on many occasions Paul went to synagogues , where he could witness to people who knew of the God of Abraham and with whom Paul could reason on the basis of the Hebrew Scriptures .—Acts 9 :19 , 20 ; 13 :5 , 14-16 ; 14 :1 ; 17 :1 , 2 .

Or you could ask if a visit may be made to the recipient ’ s home to speak with him further on the subject discussed .

1919—In each congregation a service director is appointed theocratically by the branch office . His responsibilities include organizing the preaching work and encouraging participation in the field ministry . Some of the congregation elders do not support the arrangement of having a service director .
14 Our dress , grooming , and cleanliness are even more important when we are engaging in the field ministry or attending a Christian meeting . Ask yourself : ‘ Do my appearance and personal hygiene draw undue attention to me ? Do they embarrass others ? Do I consider my rights in these areas to be more important than qualifying for service privileges in the congregation ? ’ —Psalm 68 :6 ; Philippians 4 :5 ; 1 Peter 5 :6 .
8 “ And now you think you can hold your own against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David because you are a large crowd and you have the golden calves that Jer·o·boʹam made as gods for you . 9 Have you not driven out Jehovah ’ s priests , the descendants of Aaron , and the Levites , and have you not appointed your own priests just like the peoples of the other lands ? Anyone who came along with a young bull and seven rams could become a priest of what are not gods . 10 As for us , Jehovah is our God , and we have not abandoned him ; our priests , the descendants of Aaron , are ministering to Jehovah , and the Levites assist in the work . 11 They are making burnt offerings smoke to Jehovah each morning and each evening along with perfumed incense , and the layer bread is on the table of pure gold , and they light up the golden lampstand and its lamps each evening , because we are caring for our responsibility to Jehovah our God ; but you have abandoned him . 12 Now look ! the true God is with us , leading us , with his priests and the signal trumpets for sounding the battle alarm against you .

The next day , I brought her the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work , Volume 1 . That too she gladly accepted . Her positive reaction made me think that other teachers might also be interested in that publication . So I took a carton of Young People Ask books and other publications to school . ” Before long , the carton was empty .

If the leper has been cured of the leprosy , 4 the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds , cedarwood , scarlet material , and hyssop for his cleansing . 5 The priest will command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running water . 6 But he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood , the scarlet material , and the hyssop , and dip them together in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water . 7 Then he will spatter it seven times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean , and he will set the living bird free in the open field .

( Romans 7 :21-25 ) But our love for Jehovah gives us the strength to do what is right . He sees our efforts to obey him , and he helps us by giving us his powerful holy spirit .

27 Then he made the ten carriages of copper . Each carriage was four cubits long , four cubits wide , and three cubits high . 28 And this was how the carriages were constructed : They had side panels , and the side panels were between the crossbars . 29 And on the side panels between the crossbars were lions , bulls , and cherubs , and the same design was on the crossbars . Above and beneath the lions and the bulls were wreaths in relief . 30 And each carriage had four copper wheels and copper axles , and its four cornerpieces served as supports for them . Beneath the basin were the supports , cast with wreaths at the side of each . 31 Its opening was inside the crown , extending upward one cubit ; and its opening was round , making up a stand of one and a half cubits , and on its mouth were engravings . And their side panels were square , not round . 32 The four wheels were below the side panels , and the supports of the wheels were attached to the carriage , and the height of each wheel was one and a half cubits . 33 And the wheels were made like chariot wheels . Their supports , rims , spokes , and hubs were all of cast metal . 34 There were four supports on the four corners of each carriage ; its supports were cast as part of the carriage . 35 On top of the carriage was a circular band half a cubit high , and on the top of the carriage , its framing pieces and its side panels were cast as part of it . 36 On the surfaces of its framing pieces and on its side panels he engraved cherubs , lions , and palm trees according to the amount of space on each , with wreaths all around . 37 This is how he made the ten carriages ; they were all cast alike , with the same measure and shape .

If it is confirmed to be true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel , 5 you must bring the man or the woman who has done this evil thing out to the city gates , and the man or the woman must be stoned to death . 6 On the testimony of two witnesses or of three witnesses the one who is to die should be put to death . He must not be put to death on the testimony of one witness . 7 The hand of the witnesses should be the first to come against him to put him to death , and the hand of all the people afterward .

( 1 Cor . 10 :25 , 29 , 30 ) Hence , in this important matter related to worship , each Christian needed to make a conscientious decision . Therefore , should we not also respect our brother ’ s right to make personal decisions in matters of lesser importance ? —1 Cor . 10 :32 , 33 .
16 Jehovah ’ s own Book shows why we should expect his people to be united . The psalmist sang : “ Look ! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity ! ” ( Ps . 133 :1 ) When they obeyed Jehovah , the Israelites were organized and unified . Foretelling the future condition of his people , God declared : “ In unity I will place them , like sheep in the pen . ” ( Mic . 2 :12 ) Moreover , Jehovah foretold through the prophet Zephaniah : “ I will change the language of the peoples to a pure language [ of Scriptural truth ] , so that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah , to serve him shoulder to shoulder [ or , “ worship him in unity , ” ftn . ] . ” ( Zeph . 3 :9 ) How grateful we are to have the privilege of worshipping Jehovah in unity !
21 Although we are not under the Mosaic Law , that Law gives us insight into Jehovah ’ s mind , including his thinking on forgiveness . ( Colossians 2 :13 , 14 ) If others have been hurt by our sins , God is pleased when we do what we can to right the wrong . ( Matthew 5 :23 , 24 ) This may involve acknowledging our sin , admitting our guilt , and even apologizing to the victim . Then we can appeal to Jehovah on the basis of Jesus ’ sacrifice and experience the assurance that we have been forgiven by God .—Hebrews 10 :21 , 22 .

Nonetheless , Jesus corrected them kindly and even commended them for what they had done well ; they had shown faithfulness in sticking to their Master . He foretold , however , that they would all abandon him . Peter countered that he would stick with Jesus even in the face of death . Jesus prophesied that , on the contrary , Peter would deny his Master three times that very night before a cock crowed twice . Peter then not only contradicted Jesus but boasted that he would prove more faithful than all the other apostles ! —Matt . 26 :31-35 ; Mark 14 :27-31 ; Luke 22 :24-28 ; John 13 :36-38 .

15 In the spring of 33 C .E . , Jesus Christ willingly submitted to an ordeal that led to the payment of the ransom . He allowed himself to be arrested on false charges , judged guilty , and nailed to a stake of execution . Was it really necessary for Jesus to suffer so much ? Yes , because the issue of the integrity of God ’ s servants had to be settled . Significantly , God did not allow the infant Jesus to be killed by Herod . ( Matthew 2 :13-18 ) But when Jesus was an adult , he was able to withstand the brunt of Satan ’ s attacks with full comprehension of the issues . By remaining “ loyal , guileless , undefiled , separated from the sinners ” in spite of horrific treatment , Jesus proved with dramatic finality that Jehovah does have servants who remain faithful under trial . ( Hebrews 7 :26 ) No wonder , then , that at the moment before his death , Jesus cried out triumphantly : “ It has been accomplished ! ” —John 19 :30 .

15 Interestingly , Daniel prayed this way at a time when the Jews needed Jehovah to act once again for the sake of His name . The disobedient Jews found themselves in captivity , this time in Babylon . Their own capital city , Jerusalem , lay in ruins . Daniel knew that restoring the Jews to their homeland would magnify Jehovah ’ s name . Daniel thus prayed : “ O Jehovah , do forgive . O Jehovah , do pay attention and act . Do not delay , for your own sake , O my God , for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people . ” —Daniel 9 :18 , 19 .

13 Therefore , let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret . 14 For if I am praying in a tongue , it is my gift of the spirit that is praying , but my mind is unproductive . 15 What is to be done , then ? I will pray with the gift of the spirit , but I will also pray with my mind . I will sing praise with the gift of the spirit , but I will also sing praise with my mind . 16 Otherwise , if you offer praise with a gift of the spirit , how will the ordinary person in your midst say “ Amen ” to your giving of thanks , since he does not know what you are saying ? 17 True , you are giving thanks in a fine way , but the other man is not being built up . 18 I thank God that I speak in more tongues than all of you do . 19 Nevertheless , in a congregation I would rather speak five words with my mind , that I might also instruct others , than ten thousand words in a tongue .

38 Then the prophet went and waited for the king by the road , disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes . 39 As the king was passing by , he cried out to the king : “ Your servant went into the thick of the battle , and there was a man coming out who brought a man to me and said , ‘ Guard this man . If he is found missing , your life will have to take the place of his life , or else you will pay a talent of silver . ’ 40 And while your servant was busy here and there , suddenly the man was gone . ” The king of Israel said to him : “ So your own judgment will be ; you have decided it yourself . ” 41 Then he quickly removed the bandage from his eyes , and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets . 42 He said to him : “ This is what Jehovah says , ‘ Because you have let the man whom I said should be destroyed escape from your hand , your life must take the place of his life , and your people the place of his people . ’ ” 43 At that the king of Israel went home to Sa·marʹi·a , sullen and dejected .

18 Jehovah does not coerce us into loving him and serving him . That is our choice . In line with the free will that he grants us , he respects our responsibility and right to ‘ choose for ourselves ’ whether we will serve him . ( Josh . 24 :15 ; Eccl . 5 :4 ) But he expects us to follow through on other decisions that we make based on his guidance . With faith in Jehovah ’ s way of doing things and the principles that he has kindly provided , we can make wise decisions and prove ourselves steady in all our ways .—Jas . 1 :5-8 ; 4 :8 .
13 Being willing to lay down our life for our brothers is not the only way to show self-sacrificing love . After all , few of us are ever called upon to make such a great sacrifice . However , if we love our brothers enough to die for them , should we not be willing to make smaller sacrifices , going out of our way to help them now ? To be self-sacrificing means to give up our own advantage or comfort for the benefit of others . We put their needs and welfare ahead of our own even if it is not convenient . ( 1 Corinthians 10 :24 ) In what practical ways can we show self-sacrificing love ?

16 Concerning Jehovah , it can rightly be said : “ All his ways are justice . ” ( Deuteronomy 32 :4 ) None of us can make such a claim about ourselves , for so often our limited perspective clouds our perception of what is right . For example , consider Abraham . He pleaded with Jehovah concerning the destruction of Sodom—despite the rampant wickedness there . He asked Jehovah : “ Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked ? ” ( Genesis 18 :23-33 ) Of course , the answer was no . It was only when righteous Lot and his daughters arrived safely at the city of Zoar that Jehovah “ made it rain sulphur and fire ” upon Sodom . ( Genesis 19 :22-24 ) In contrast , Jonah became “ hot with anger ” when God extended mercy to the people of Nineveh . Since Jonah had already announced their destruction , he would have been content to see them exterminated—regardless of their heartfelt repentance .—Jonah 3 :10–4 :1 .

Jehovah is able and willing to give us strength by means of his holy spirit . ( 1 Chron . 29 :12 ) It is vital that we draw on that spirit so that we can face any challenge that Satan and his wicked system thrust upon us . ( Ps . 18 :39 ; 1 Cor . 10 :13 ) Also , we can be grateful that we have God ’ s Word , which is a product of holy spirit . Think , too , about the spiritual food based on the Bible that we receive each month . The words of Zechariah 8 :9 , 13 were spoken while the temple in Jerusalem was being rebuilt , and those words are very fitting for us . We are also made stronger by divine education at our Christian meetings , assemblies , conventions , and in our theocratic schools . That training can help us to have the proper motivation , to set spiritual goals , and to fulfill our many Christian responsibilities . ( Ps . 119 :32 ) Do you eagerly seek to gain strength from that type of education ? w16 .09 1 :10 , 11

3 Does that scene strike you as a bittersweet ending , a forlorn farewell ? It is not . In fact , as two angels now remind the apostles , Jesus ’ story is far from over . ( Acts 1 :10 , 11 ) In many ways , his departure toward heaven is just a beginning . God ’ s Word does not leave us in the dark about what next happened to Jesus . Learning about the life Jesus has led since leaving the earth is important . Why ? Remember the words Jesus spoke to Peter : “ Continue following me . ” ( John 21 :19 , 22 ) We all need to obey that command , not merely as a momentary choice but as a way of life . In order to do so , we need to understand what our Master is doing now and the assignments he has received in heaven .

Like that candy , holidays may seem sweet , but they have been picked up from unclean places .

Actually , they were prepared to be away for longer than a day . Why ? They had already been arrested on several occasions , so they realized that they could be arrested again .

17 Christ could not take his literal blood into heaven . ( 1 Corinthians 15 :50 ) Rather , he took what that blood symbolized : the legal value of his sacrificed perfect human life .

Yes , and this became evident at Pentecost 33 C .E . , when the holy spirit was poured out upon about 120 disciples in Jerusalem . ( Acts 2 :1-4 ) Thrilling though that was , the ransom was then just beginning to provide marvelous benefits .

Then Eʹhud said : “ I have a message from God for you . ” So he rose up from his throne . 21 Then Eʹhud drew the sword from his right thigh with his left hand and plunged it into his belly . 22 The handle went in after the blade , and the fat closed in over the blade , for he did not draw the sword out of his belly , and the fecal matter came out . 23 Eʹhud went out through the porch , closing the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locking them . 24 After he left , the servants returned and saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked . So they said : “ He must be relieving himself in the cool interior room . ” 25 They kept waiting until they were embarrassed , but when they saw that he was still not opening the doors of the roof chamber , they took the key and opened them and saw their lord fallen to the floor dead !

15 How , though , do the pure in heart “ see God ” when , in fact , “ no man can see [ God ] and live ” ? ( Ex . 33 :20 ) The Greek word rendered “ see ” can carry the sense of “ to see with the mind , to perceive , know . ” Those who see God with ‘ the eyes of the heart ’ are those who have really come to know him , appreciating his qualities . ( Eph . 1 :18 ) Jesus perfectly reflected God ’ s personality , so he could say : “ Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also . ” —John 14 :7-9 .

Hez·e·kiʹah then went up to the house of Jehovah and spread them out before Jehovah . 15 And Hez·e·kiʹah began to pray to Jehovah and say : 16 “ O Jehovah of armies , the God of Israel , sitting enthroned above the cherubs , you alone are the true God of all the kingdoms of the earth . You made the heavens and the earth . 17 Incline your ear , O Jehovah , and hear ! Open your eyes , O Jehovah , and see ! Hear all the words that Sen·nachʹer·ib has sent to taunt the living God . 18 It is a fact , O Jehovah , that the kings of As·syrʹi·a have devastated all the lands , as well as their own land . 19 And they have thrown their gods into the fire , because they were not gods but the work of human hands , wood and stone . That is why they could destroy them . 20 But now , O Jehovah our God , save us out of his hand , so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are God , O Jehovah . ”

9 When the disobedient angels returned to heaven , they were treated as outcasts , like their ruler , Satan . ( 2 Peter 2 :4 ) Although they are now unable to take on human bodies , they still exercise a very bad influence over humans . In fact , with the help of these demons , Satan “ is misleading the entire inhabited earth . ” ( Revelation 12 :9 ; 1 John 5 :19 ) How ? Mainly , the demons use methods designed to mislead people . ( Read 2 Corinthians 2 :11 . ) Let us consider some of these methods .

18 Jesus was reasonable . When Jesus was in Tyre , a woman came to him because her daughter was “ badly demonized . ” In three different ways , Jesus indicated that he was not inclined to do what she wanted . First , he responded with silence ; second , he gave her a reason why he should not do as she asked ; third , he gave an illustration that made the point even clearer . Yet , was his manner cold , unyielding ? Did he imply that she was on dangerous ground in daring to counter the words of so great a man ? No , this woman clearly felt safe . She not only asked for help but persisted even in the face of his apparent unwillingness to help her . Jesus saw the remarkable faith that moved her to persist , and he healed her daughter . ( Matthew 15 :22-28 ) Surely Jesus ’ reasonableness , his willingness to listen and to yield when appropriate , made people eager to approach him !

Yes , he will bless you with many children and with the produce of your soil , your grain , your new wine , your oil , the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks , in the land that he swore to your forefathers to give to you . 14 You will become the most blessed of all the peoples ; no man or woman among you will be childless , nor will your livestock be without young . 15 Jehovah will take away from you all sickness , and he will not bring upon you any of the terrible diseases that you have known in Egypt . Instead , he will bring them upon all those who hate you . 16 You are to destroy all the peoples whom Jehovah your God gives over to you . You must not feel sorry for them , and you must not serve their gods , because that would be a snare to you .
Psalm 138 :6
And I repent in dust and ashes . ”

7 We all agree that being part of the Christian congregation is a blessing . The study of God ’ s Word at our meetings and the kind and loving support that we give one another help us to keep our eyes focused on the prize . Nevertheless , at times , misunderstandings may lead to some tension among members of the congregation . If we fail to resolve such problems , they could easily lead to feelings of resentment .—Read 1 Peter 3 :8 , 9 .

21 Perhaps you remember a time when someone gave you some good advice in a way that was easy to accept . What made it so effective ? You probably felt that the person really cared about you . Or maybe he or she spoke in a kind and loving way . ( Colossians 4 :6 ) Likely , the advice was based on the Bible . ( 2 Timothy 3 :16 ) Whether we quote directly from the Bible or not , there should be a Scriptural basis for any advice we give . Nobody should force his opinions on others or misapply scriptures to support his own ideas . Remembering the way advice was given to you can help you when you give advice to others .

6 The tragic , long-term consequences of independence from God have once and for all demonstrated that rulership by humans can never succeed . God ’ s rulership is the only way to happiness , unity , health , and life . And God ’ s Word shows that Jehovah ’ s toleration of independent human rule is nearing its end . ( Matthew 24 :3-14 ; 2 Timothy 3 :1-5 ) Shortly , he will intervene in human affairs to assert his rulership over the earth . Bible prophecy states : “ In the days of those kings [ human rulerships now existing ] the God of heaven will set up a kingdom [ in heaven ] that will never be brought to ruin . And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people [ never again will humans rule the earth ] . It will crush and put an end to all these [ present-day ] kingdoms , and it itself will stand to times indefinite . ” —Daniel 2 :44 .

26 In ancient Israel , Jehovah told the prophet Ezekiel to warn people that Jerusalem would soon be destroyed and to teach them what they needed to do to survive . If Ezekiel did not warn the people , Jehovah would hold him responsible for their lives . ( Ezekiel 33 :7-9 ) Ezekiel showed that he valued life by doing all he could to share that important message .

HAVE you ever thought , ‘ Am I the kind of person Jehovah will want to save during the great tribulation and bring into the new world ? ’ Of course , surviving involves several factors , but one very important requirement is highlighted by the apostle Paul : “ Without faith it is impossible to please God well . ” ( Heb . 11 :6 ) This may sound very basic , but the truth is that “ faith is not a possession of all people . ” ( 2 Thess . 3 :2 ) These texts help us understand how important it is to cultivate strong faith .

I will only speak what Jehovah will tell me ’ ? 14 And now I am going away to my people . Come and let me advise you what this people will do to your people in the future . ” 15 So he spoke this proverbial saying :
26 “ When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you , and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled them , 27 may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants , of your people Israel , for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk ; and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance .
To another man , Jesus says : “ Be my follower . ” The man replies : “ Lord , permit me first to go and bury my father . ” Knowing the man ’ s circumstances , Jesus says : “ Let the dead bury their dead , but you go and declare abroad the Kingdom of God . ” ( Luke 9 :59 , 60 ) The father evidently has not yet died . If he had , it is unlikely that his son would be here talking with Jesus . The son is not prepared to put the Kingdom of God first in his life .

To anyone thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life free . 7 Anyone conquering will inherit these things , and I will be his God and he will be my son . 8 But as for the cowards and those without faith and those who are disgusting in their filth and murderers and the sexually immoral and those practicing spiritism and idolaters and all the liars , their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur . This means the second death . ”
16 Being modest does not mean that we should never reach out for or accept additional privileges of service . The Scriptures encourage all of us to make advancement . ( 1 Tim . 4 :13-15 ) Does this always require a change of assignment though ? Not necessarily . With Jehovah ’ s blessing , we can make spiritual progress in whatever role we are currently serving . We can continue to cultivate our God-given abilities and expand in doing good works .
Within the Christian congregation , we may be called upon to relinquish a right in order to maintain peace . A goodly number of those now associating with Jehovah ’ s Witnesses have come into God ’ s family of true worshipers in the last five years . What joy this brings to our hearts ! The way we comport ourselves surely affects these and others in the congregation . This is a good reason for giving careful thought to our choice of entertainment , hobbies , social pastimes , or employment , considering how others may perceive us . Could any of our actions or words be misunderstood and thus be a cause for stumbling others ?

Do you not yet perceive and understand ? Are your hearts still dull in understanding ? 18 ‘ Though having eyes , do you not see ; and though having ears , do you not hear ? ’ Do you not remember 19 when I broke the five loaves for the 5 ,000 men , how many baskets full of fragments you collected ? ” They said to him : “ Twelve . ” 20 “ When I broke the seven loaves for the 4 ,000 men , how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up ? ” And they said to him : “ Seven . ” 21 With that he said to them : “ Do you not yet understand ? ”

20 Jehovah is not just willing to reward his faithful servants—he is eager to do so . ( Isaiah 30 :18 ; read Malachi 3 :10 . ) He delights in granting his servants the righteous desires of their heart . ( Psalm 37 :4 ) So keep your mind firmly focused on the hope that lies before you . Never give in to the negative , degraded , twisted thinking of Satan ’ s old world . If you sense that the spirit of this world is making inroads into your mind or heart , pray fervently to Jehovah for “ the peace of God that surpasses all understanding . ” That God-given peace will guard your heart and your mental powers .—Philippians 4 :6 , 7 .

To illustrate : If a man asked your forgiveness for stealing your money , you might decide not to press charges . But would you trust him to run your business or to take care of your family ? You would reserve such responsibilities only for those in whom you had the utmost confidence . Likewise , those who are given the hope of life in heaven must provide a solid basis for confidence that they will uphold God ’ s righteous standards when they rule over mankind . ( Revelation 2 :10 ) The evildoer , though apparently sincere in his last-minute plea , provided no such basis .

This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace , the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings , or mandatory first aid training within schools . First aid , however , does not necessarily require any particular equipment or prior knowledge , and can involve improvisation with materials available at the time , often by untrained persons .

Peter faithfully carried out his assignment for many years . He strengthened his brothers , as Jesus had commanded on the eve of His death . Peter worked kindly and patiently at shepherding and feeding Christ ’ s followers . The man called Simon came to live up to the name Jesus gave him—Peter , or Rock—by becoming a steady , strong , reliable force for good in the congregation . Much evidence to that effect is found in the two warm , personal letters Peter wrote that became valuable books of the Bible . Those letters show , too , that Peter never forgot the lesson he learned from Jesus about forgiveness .—1 Peter 3 :8 , 9 ; 4 :8 .

17 “ Just as the time was approaching to fulfill the promise that God had announced to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt , 18 until there rose a different king over Egypt , one who did not know of Joseph . 19 This one dealt cunningly with our race and wrongfully forced the fathers to abandon their infants so that they would not be kept alive . 20 At that time Moses was born , and he was divinely beautiful . And he was nursed for three months in his father ’ s home . 21 But when he was abandoned , the daughter of Pharʹaoh took him and brought him up as her own son . 22 So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians . In fact , he was powerful in his words and deeds .

13 Before his death , Jesus said to his apostles : “ Take courage ! I have conquered the world . ” ( John 16 :33 ) They too could be conquerors . Some 60 years later , the apostle John wrote : “ Who is the one that conquers the world but he who has faith that Jesus is the Son of God ? ” ( 1 John 5 :5 ) Such faith is shown by our obeying Jesus ’ commands and relying on God ’ s Word , even as Jesus did . What else is required ? That we stay close to the congregation of which he is Head . When we fall short , we must earnestly repent and seek God ’ s forgiveness on the basis of Jesus ’ sacrifice . In this way , despite our imperfections and mistakes , we too can be conquerors .—Psalm 130 :3 , 4 .

4 The Bible contrasts modesty with presumptuousness . ( Read Proverbs 11 :2 . ) Wisely , David asked Jehovah to “ hold [ him ] back from presumptuous acts . ” ( Ps . 19 :13 ) What are “ presumptuous acts ” ? By definition , when someone rashly or impertinently does something that he is not authorized to do , he is acting presumptuously . Because of inherited sin , we all act presumptuously at times . But as King Saul ’ s example illustrates , if we develop a pattern of pushing ahead , sooner or later we will find ourselves in serious trouble with God . Psalm 119 :21 says of Jehovah : “ You rebuke the presumptuous . ” Why is that ?

In the past , we have explained that in the modern-day fulfillment of this vision , the man with the secretary ’ s inkhorn represented the anointed remnant . It was thought that those who respond favorably to the message being preached are now marked for survival . In recent years , however , it has become clear that an adjustment needs to be made to this explanation . According to what is stated at Matthew 25 :31-33 , Jesus is the one who judges people . He makes his final judgment during the time of the great tribulation , separating the sheeplike ones , who will survive , from the goatlike ones , who will be destroyed .

12 The fruitage of such so-called freedom is always bad , since it means disobeying God ’ s laws . For example , illicit sex can result in emotional turmoil , disease , death , unwanted pregnancy , and possibly the breakup of a marriage . ( 1 Corinthians 6 :18 ; 1 Thessalonians 4 :3-8 ) Drug abuse can produce irritability , slurred speech , blurred vision , dizziness , impaired ability to breathe , hallucinations , and death . It can result in addiction , which may lead to crime in order to support the habit . Much the same consequences come from alcohol abuse . ( Proverbs 23 :29-35 ) Those who get involved in such conduct may think that they are free , but then they find out too late that they have become slaves to sin . And what a cruel master sin is ! Reasoning on the matter now can help to safeguard us against such an experience .—Galatians 6 :7 , 8 .

In fact , Paul calls Jehovah ’ s throne “ the throne of undeserved kindness ” and invites us to approach it “ with freeness of speech . ” ( Heb . 4 :16a ) Jehovah has afforded us this privilege through his Son , “ by means of whom we have this freeness of speech and free access with confidence through our faith in him . ” ( Eph . 3 :12 ) Free access to Jehovah in prayer is indeed a wonderful expression of his undeserved kindness .
15 Notice that Satan said : “ A man will give everything that he has for his life . ” ( Job 2 :4 ) By saying “ a man , ” Satan made it clear that his charge applied not just to Job but to all humans . That is a very important point . Satan has called into question your integrity to God . The Devil would like to see you disobey God and abandon a righteous course when difficulties arise . How might Satan try to accomplish this ?

20 Satan ’ s world does not respect life , and Jehovah views it as bloodguilty , that is , guilty of murder . Over the centuries , political powers have caused millions of people to die , including many of Jehovah ’ s servants . In the Bible , these powers , or governments , are described as fierce and violent beasts . ( Daniel 8 :3 , 4 , 20-22 ; Revelation 13 :1 , 2 , 7 , 8 ) In today ’ s world , the sale of weapons is big business . People make huge profits selling such deadly weapons .

Jesus knew that his earthly ministry would come to an end and that others would carry on his work . Though his disciples were imperfect , he had confidence in them and told them that they would do works greater than he did . ( John 14 :12 ) He trained them thoroughly , and they spread the good news throughout the then-known world . ( Col . 1 :23 ) After his sacrificial death , Jesus was resurrected to heaven where he was given more work to do with authority “ far above every government and authority and power and lordship . ” ( Eph . 1 :19-21 ) If we die faithful before Armageddon , we will be resurrected into a righteous new world , where there will be plenty of satisfying work for us to do . Now , though , there is vitally important work that all of us can participate in—preaching the good news and making disciples . May all of us , young or old , keep on “ having plenty to do in the work of the Lord . ” w17 .01 5 :17 , 18

Here I am driving out from before you the Amʹor·ites , the Caʹnaan·ites , the Hitʹtites , the Perʹiz·zites , the Hiʹvites , and the Jebʹu·sites . 12 Be careful that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going , or it may prove to be a snare among you . 13 But you are to pull down their altars , you are to shatter their sacred pillars , and their sacred poles you are to cut down . 14 You must not bow down to another god , for Jehovah is known for requiring exclusive devotion . Yes , he is a God who requires exclusive devotion . 15 Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , because when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods , someone will invite you and you will eat from his sacrifice . 16 Then you will surely take some of their daughters for your sons , and their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves to their gods .

16 While undeserved kindness from Jehovah provides us with many blessings , we should not presumptuously think that he condones all conduct . Among the early Christians , there were some who attempted to “ turn the undeserved kindness of . . . God into an excuse for brazen conduct . ” ( Jude 4 ) These unfaithful Christians apparently thought that they could sin and then count on Jehovah to forgive them . Worse still , they endeavored to entice their brothers to join them in their contemptuous ways . Even today , anyone doing that “ has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness . ” —Heb . 10 :29 .

Remember , you and I were riding together behind Aʹhab his father when Jehovah himself made this pronouncement against him : 26 ‘ “ As surely as I saw the blood of Naʹboth and the blood of his sons yesterday , ” declares Jehovah , “ I will repay you in this very plot of land , ” declares Jehovah . ’ So now pick him up and throw him into the plot of land , according to the word of Jehovah . ”

Millions of modern-day worshippers of God are following the example of Jesus by keeping their hope in clear focus and not allowing trials to weaken their faith . Consider the example of Rudolf Graichen , who was born in Germany in 1925 . He recalled pictures of Bible scenes that hung on the walls of his home . “ One picture , ” he wrote , “ showed the wolf and the lamb , the kid and the leopard , the calf and the lion—all in peace , being led by a little boy . . . . Such pictures made a lasting impression on me . ” ( Isa . 11 :6-9 ) Despite many years of cruel persecution , first by the Nazi Gestapo and later by the Communist Stasi of East Germany , Rudolf maintained his strong faith in an earthly paradise . Other severe trials faced by Rudolf were the loss of his beloved mother , who died of typhus in the Ravensbrück concentration camp , and seeing his father weaken in faith and renounce being one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . w16 .10 3 :12-14

12 Then he started to speak to them with illustrations : “ A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a vat for the winepress and erected a tower ; then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad . 2 In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators to collect some of the fruits of the vineyard from them . 3 But they took him , beat him , and sent him away empty-handed . 4 Again he sent another slave to them , and that one they struck on the head and dishonored . 5 And he sent another , and that one they killed , and many others , some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed . 6 One more he had , a beloved son . He sent him to them last , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’ 7 But those cultivators said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . ’ 8 So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard . 9 What will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and kill the cultivators and will give the vineyard to others . 10 Did you never read this scripture : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected , this has become the chief cornerstone . 11 This has come from Jehovah , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ? ”

( Matthew 21 :23 , 45 ; 22 :23 ; 26 :59 ) No doubt , many—if not all—of Jesus ’ apostles and disciples were able to write .

We can do so if we keep on fighting against it . In contrast , we could be overcome by Satan , his evil world , and our imperfect flesh if we let our guard down and quit fighting . Never allow Satan to intimidate you into dropping your hands in defeat ! —1 Pet . 5 :9 .

8 As the officer spoke to his men , two strangers came up to the family and quietly identified themselves as Witnesses . They had heard of the crisis from others on the bus . The two told Milan and his brother to get into their car to cross the border , as the children ’ s papers were not being checked . The newcomers then told the parents to walk around the back of the border post and meet them on the other side . Milan did not know whether to laugh or to cry at this suggestion . “ Do you think they are just going to let us walk off ? ” his parents asked . Yet , as they walked away , it seemed as if the soldiers were staring right through them . The parents and children were reunited on the other side of the border . They proceeded to the convention city , convinced that Jehovah had answered their desperate prayers for help . We know from the Bible that there have been times when Jehovah did not directly intervene to protect his servants . ( Acts 7 :58-60 ) Yet , Milan shares how he felt . He says , “ It seemed to me that the angels blinded the soldiers and that Jehovah rescued us . ” —Ps . 97 :10 .

11 One of their tricks is called divination . That is the use of supernatural powers to try to find out about the future or the unknown . Someone might try to do this by looking at the stars , searching for omens , reading tarot cards , using a crystal ball , or reading the palm of a person ’ s hand . Many people think that these practices are harmless , but they are not . They are very dangerous . For example , the Bible shows that demons and fortune-tellers work together . At Acts 16 :16-18 , we read about “ a demon of divination ” who helped a girl to do “ fortune-telling . ” After the apostle Paul sent the demon away , the girl lost her ability to foretell the future .

6 Consider first the term “ flesh . ” To what was Paul referring ? The Bible uses “ flesh ” in different ways . At times , it applies to the actual flesh of our physical body .

Jesus was “ from the offspring of David according to the flesh , ” and Paul saw the Jews as “ relatives according to the flesh . ” —Rom . 1 :3 ; 9 :3 .

15 Do you believe that we are living in the last days ? Many Bible prophecies about the last days are coming true . Soon Jehovah will decide to stop the preaching of the good news and “ the end ” will come . ( Matthew 24 :14 ) What is the end ? It is Armageddon , when God will remove all wickedness . Jehovah will use Jesus and his powerful angels to destroy anyone who refuses to obey Him and his Son . ( 2 Thessalonians 1 :6-9 ) After that , Satan and his demons will not mislead people . And all those who want to obey God and accept his Kingdom will see every promise of God come true .—Revelation 20 :1-3 ; 21 :3-5 .
Getting involved in wars or politics
16 As discussed in Chapter 10 , Satan uses various methods to try to turn people away from God . On the one hand , he attacks “ like a roaring lion , seeking to devour someone . ” ( 1 Peter 5 :8 ) Thus Satan ’ s influence may be seen when friends , relatives , or others oppose your efforts to study the Bible and apply what you learn . ( John 15 :19 , 20 ) On the other hand , Satan “ keeps disguising himself as an angel of light . ” ( 2 Corinthians 11 :14 ) The Devil can use subtle means to mislead you and lure you away from a godly way of life . He can also use discouragement , perhaps causing you to feel that you are not good enough to please God . ( Proverbs 24 :10 ) Whether Satan is acting like “ a roaring lion ” or posing as “ an angel of light , ” his challenge remains the same : He says that when you are faced with trials or temptations , you will stop serving God . How can you answer his challenge and prove your integrity to God , as Job did ?

17 Husbands , how can you imitate Jesus in showing self-sacrificing love ? The Bible answers : “ Husbands , continue loving your wives , just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it . ” ( Ephesians 5 :25 ) As we have seen , Jesus loved his followers so much that he died for them . A Christian husband imitates the unselfish attitude of Jesus , who “ did not please himself . ” ( Romans 15 :3 ) Such a husband willingly puts his wife ’ s needs and interests before his own . He does not rigidly insist on having his own way , but he shows a willingness to yield when there is no Scriptural issue involved . The husband who shows self-sacrificing love gains Jehovah ’ s approval and wins the love and respect of his wife and children .

As the term “ charitable planning ” implies , these types of donations typically require some planning on the part of the donor . To assist individuals desiring to benefit the worldwide work of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses through some form of charitable giving , a brochure entitled Charitable Planning to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide has been prepared . The brochure , available in English and Spanish , was written to provide information on a variety of ways that gifts may be made now or later , such as through a bequest at death . The information covered in this brochure may not apply fully to your situation because of tax laws or other laws in your country . By using such methods of charitable giving , many have helped to support our religious and humanitarian activities worldwide and maximize tax benefits . If available in your country , the brochure may be obtained by requesting a copy from the secretary of the local congregation .

13 David asked the young man who brought him the news : “ Where are you from ? ” He said : “ I am the son of a foreign resident , an A·malʹek·ite . ” 14 Then David said to him : “ Why did you not fear to lift your hand to do away with the anointed of Jehovah ? ” 15 With that David called one of the young men and said : “ Step forward and strike him . ” So he struck him down , and he died . 16 David said to him : “ Your blood is on your own head , because your own mouth testified against you by saying , ‘ I myself put the anointed of Jehovah to death . ’ ”
6 By promising his worshippers a reward , Jehovah helps to sustain them during tests of integrity . Besides enjoying rich spiritual blessings now , Jehovah God ’ s faithful servants eagerly look forward to even greater blessings in the future . ( 1 Tim . 4 :8 ) Yes , our being firmly convinced that Jehovah “ becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him ” will help us to stand firm in the faith .—Heb . 11 :6 .

4 . How would you define a presumptuous act ?
Rather than thinking in terms of how many points you have covered on your speech counsel form or the type of assignments that you have been given , reflect on the extent to which the training has improved the quality of your sacrifice of praise . The school prepares us to be more effective in the field ministry . So ask yourself : ‘ Do I really prepare what I am going to say in the field service ? Have I learned to show personal interest in those to whom I witness ? Do I lay the groundwork for return visits by leaving people with a question for discussion the next time ? If I am studying the Bible with someone , am I working to improve as a teacher who reaches the heart ? ’

18 As a young man , Joseph was a slave in Egypt . Day after day , his master ’ s wife asked him to have sex with her , but Joseph knew that doing so would be wrong . Joseph loved Jehovah and wanted to please him . So each time the woman tried to seduce Joseph , he refused . Since he was a slave , he could not just leave his master . One day after the master ’ s wife tried to force him to have sex with her , he “ fled outside . ” —Read Genesis 39 :7-12 .

One day in May 1955 when we arrived home from field service , Brother Leach and I found a pack of letters in our room . We learned that we were being assigned as circuit overseers . I was only 22 years old , but this assignment gave me the opportunity to “ become all things to people of all sorts ” in new ways .
23 Therefore , it was necessary for the typical representations of the things in the heavens to be cleansed by these means , but the heavenly things require far better sacrifices . 24 For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands , which is a copy of the reality , but into heaven itself , so that he now appears before God on our behalf . 25 This was not done to offer himself often , as when the high priest enters into the holy place from year to year with blood that is not his own . 26 Otherwise , he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world . But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself . 27 And just as it is reserved for men to die once for all time , but after this to receive a judgment , 28 so also the Christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many ; and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin , and he will be seen by those earnestly looking for him for their salvation .

17 Regarding the objective of the Kingdom Ministry School , the 1962 Yearbook of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses stated : “ In this very busy world an overseer in the congregation of Jehovah ’ s witnesses must be a man who can organize his life so as to give the proper attention to all in the congregation and be a blessing to them . At the same time he can not be a man who ignores his own family in favor of the congregation , but he must use the spirit of a sound mind . What a wonderful opportunity has been afforded the congregation servants throughout the world of coming together at the Kingdom Ministry School to get a training that will help them to do just what the Bible says an overseer should be able to accomplish ! ” —1 Tim . 3 :1-7 ; Titus 1 :5-9 .
20 Truly , Jehovah ’ s Word beautifully describes the love of the Christ . How , though , should we respond to Jesus ’ love ? The Bible urges us “ to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge . ” ( Ephesians 3 :19 ) As we have seen , the Gospel accounts of Jesus ’ life and ministry teach us much about Christ ’ s love . However , fully coming “ to know the love of the Christ ” involves more than learning what the Bible says about him .

And from morning to evening , he explained the matter to them by bearing thorough witness concerning the Kingdom of God , to persuade them about Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets . 24 Some began to believe the things he said ; others would not believe . 25 So because they disagreed with one another , they began to leave , and Paul made this one comment :

The walls of Jerusalem are broken down , and its gates have been burned with fire . ”

You will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide . ” 26 Then the king of Israel said : “ Take Mi·caiʹah and turn him over to Aʹmon the chief of the city and to Joʹash the king ’ s son . 27 Tell them , ‘ This is what the king says : “ Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until I return in peace . ” ’ ” 28 But Mi·caiʹah said : “ If you do return in peace , Jehovah has not spoken with me . ” Then he added : “ Take note , all you peoples . ”

17 Why Modesty Still Matters
Lu 21 :15 w . that opposers will not resist
In God ’ s Word , we find Jesus ’ soothing sayings . His words and teachings were a source of refreshment to his listeners . Multitudes were drawn to him because he calmed troubled hearts , strengthened the weak , and consoled the depressed . ( Matt . 11 :28-30 ) He showed loving consideration for others ’ spiritual , emotional , and physical needs . ( Mark 6 :30-32 ) Jesus ’ promise of support still applies . It can prove to be as true for you as it was for the apostles traveling with Jesus . You do not have to be in Jesus ’ physical presence to benefit . As heavenly King , Jesus continues to have and show empathy . Thus , when you are anxious , he can mercifully ‘ come to your aid ’ and ‘ help you at the right time . ’ Yes , Jesus can help you to cope with distress , and he can fill your heart with hope and courage .—Heb . 2 :17 , 18 ; 4 :16 . w16 .12 3 :4 , 6

“ Sins can be hidden . ” In truth , Jehovah sees everything that we do . “ All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account . ” ( Hebrews 4 :13 ) Since Jehovah knows the facts and since we must give an account to him , why add to our guilt by attempting to hide a serious sin from his human servants ? —See also 2 Samuel 12 :12 .

The only thing I ask of you is that you do not try to see my face unless first you bring Miʹchal , Saul ’ s daughter , when you come to see me . ” 14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-boʹsheth , Saul ’ s son , saying : “ Give me my wife Miʹchal , to whom I became engaged for 100 foreskins of the Phi·lisʹtines . ” 15 So Ish-boʹsheth sent to take her from her husband , Palʹti·el the son of Laʹish . 16 But her husband kept walking with her , weeping as he followed her as far as Ba·huʹrim .

Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise . 6 Finally , about the 11th hour , he went out and found others standing around , and he said to them , ‘ Why have you been standing here all day unemployed ? ’ 7 They replied , ‘ Because nobody has hired us . ’ He said to them , ‘ You too go into the vineyard . ’
13 In fulfilling her role , a wife can do much in caring for the family . For example , the Bible shows that married women are “ to love their husbands , to love their children , to be sound in mind , chaste , working at home , good , subjecting themselves to their own husbands . ” ( Titus 2 :4 , 5 ) A wife and mother who acts in this way will gain the lasting love and respect of her family . ( Read Proverbs 31 :10 , 28 . ) Since marriage is a union of imperfect individuals , however , some extreme circumstances may result in separation or divorce . The Bible allows for separation under certain circumstances . Yet , separation must not be taken lightly , for the Bible counsels : “ A wife should not separate from her husband . . . , and a husband should not leave his wife . ” ( 1 Corinthians 7 :10 , 11 ) And only sexual immorality by one of the marriage mates provides Scriptural grounds for divorce .—Matthew 19 :9 .

4 So , my brothers , you also were made dead to the Law through the body of the Christ , that you might become another ’ s , the one who was raised up from the dead , so that we should bear fruit to God . 5 For when we were living according to the flesh , the sinful passions that were awakened by the Law were at work in our bodies to produce fruit for death . 6 But now we have been released from the Law , because we have died to that which restrained us , in order that we might be slaves in a new sense by the spirit and not in the old sense by the written code .

Or he can let the movement of the earth and the moon remain undisturbed while refracting the rays from the sun and the moon in such a way that the light from these two luminaries continues to shine .

16 Jesus said to him : “ A man was spreading a grand evening meal , and he invited many . 17 He sent his slave out at the hour of the evening meal to say to the invited ones , ‘ Come , because everything is now ready . ’ 18 But they all alike began to make excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I bought a field and need to go out and see it ; I ask you , have me excused . ’ 19 And another said , ‘ I bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them ; I ask you , have me excused . ’ 20 Still another said , ‘ I just got married , and for this reason I can not come . ’ 21 So the slave came and reported these things to his master . Then the master of the house became angry and said to his slave , ‘ Go out quickly to the main streets and the alleys of the city , and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame . ’ 22 In time the slave said , ‘ Master , what you ordered has been done , and still there is room . ’ 23 So the master said to the slave , ‘ Go out to the roads and the lanes and compel them to come in , so that my house may be filled . 24 For I say to you , none of those men who were invited will taste my evening meal . ’ ”

6 Some brothers saw the issue clearly and met it head-on . Herbert Senior , quoted earlier , said : “ To me , there was no difference in principle between unloading shells from a ship [ noncombatant service ] and putting those shells into a gun to be fired . ” ( Luke 16 :10 ) As a result of his conscientious objection to military service , Brother Senior was sent to prison . He and 4 other brothers were among a group of 16 conscientious objectors , including men from other religious denominations , who served some of their time at Richmond prison in Britain and later became known as the Richmond 16 . At one point , Herbert and others like him were secretly shipped to the front lines in France . There , they were sentenced to be shot . He and a number of others were lined up in front of a firing squad , but they were not killed . Instead , their sentence was commuted to ten years in prison .

7 This does not mean that at present true Christians no longer feel the effects of the inborn tendency toward sinful conduct . Since they have inherited sin , they still have a struggle because of it . ( Romans 7 :21-25 ) If a person really lives in harmony with Jesus ’ teachings , however , he will no longer be a slave to sin . No longer will sin be to him like a dictator who gives him orders that he must blindly obey . He will not be trapped in a way of life that lacks purpose and that leaves him with a bad conscience . He will enjoy a clean conscience before God because past sins have been forgiven on the basis of his faith in the sacrifice of Christ . Sinful inclinations may try to assert themselves , but when he refuses to act on them because he calls to mind the clean teachings of Christ , he shows that sin is no longer his master .—Romans 6 :12-17 .

10 By practicing spiritism , or demonism , one makes direct contact with wicked spirits . Divination , sorcery , binding with spells , and inquiring of the dead are some forms of spiritism . As we well know , Jehovah views spiritism as “ detestable . ” ( Deuteronomy 18 :10-12 ; Revelation 21 :8 ) Since we too must “ abhor what is wicked , ” it is unthinkable that we would ever seek out the company of wicked spirit forces . ( Romans 12 :9 ) What a repulsive act of betrayal against our heavenly Father , Jehovah , that would be !

God ’ s people work hard to apply the Bible ’ s admonition : “ Deaden , therefore , your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality , uncleanness , uncontrolled sexual passion . ” ( Col . 3 :2 , 5 ) We would not want to make it difficult for fellow believers to heed that counsel . Brothers and sisters who have given up a sexually loose lifestyle may still be fighting sinful leanings . ( 1 Cor . 6 :9 , 10 ) We would not want to make their fight harder , would we ? When we are around our spiritual brothers and sisters , our manner of dress should help to make the congregation a haven of moral chastity . We have the freedom to choose what to wear . Still , all of us have a responsibility to wear clothes that make it easier for others to remain chaste and to maintain God ’ s standards of holiness in thought , word , and conduct .—1 Pet . 1 :15 , 16 . w16 .09 3 :9 , 10

7 Jehovah has more than knowledge . He also sees how facts interrelate and discerns the overall picture that is created by myriad details . He evaluates and judges , distinguishing between good and bad , important and trivial . Moreover , he looks beyond the surface and peers right into the heart . ( 1 Samuel 16 :7 ) Thus , Jehovah has understanding and discernment , qualities that are superior to knowledge . But wisdom is of a still higher order .
28 Zaire . In the mid-1980 ’ s , there were about 35 ,000 Witnesses in Zaire , now the Democratic Republic of Congo . To keep up with the steady growth of Kingdom activities , the branch was constructing new facilities . In December 1985 , an international convention was held in the capital city , Kinshasa , and 32 ,000 delegates from many parts of the world filled the city ’ s stadium . But then , conditions for Jehovah ’ s servants began to change . What happened ?
16 “ I have said these things to you so that you may not be stumbled . 2 Men will expel you from the synagogue . In fact , the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think he has offered a sacred service to God . 3 But they will do these things because they have not come to know either the Father or me . 4 Nevertheless , I have told you these things so that when the hour for them to happen arrives , you will remember that I told them to you .
2 Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt ,
17 For the wicked , the situation is different . Soon they will reap the bad they have sown . “ Calamity will put the wicked one himself to death ; and the very ones hating the righteous one will be held guilty . ” ( Psalm 34 :21 ) All who continue to oppose God ’ s people face the worst possible calamity . At the revelation of Jesus Christ , they “ will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction . ” —2 Thessalonians 1 :9 .

Let all who are around him bring their gift in fear .

10 From the barley harvest in April until the wheat harvest in June , Ruth kept gleaning in the fields of Boaz . As the weeks passed , Naomi no doubt thought more about what she could do for her beloved daughter-in-law . Back in Moab , Naomi had been convinced that she could never help Ruth find another husband . ( Ruth 1 :11-13 ) Now , though , she was beginning to think differently . She approached Ruth and said : “ My daughter , ought I not to look for a resting-place for you ? ” ( Ruth 3 :1 ) It was customary in those days for parents to find mates for their children , and Ruth had become a true daughter to Naomi . She wanted to find Ruth “ a resting-place ” —referring to the security and protection that a home and a husband might provide . But what could Naomi do ?

After you have determined your objective and have selected a theme consistent with it ( or analyzed how your assigned theme fits in with that objective ) , you can do research that is more focused . Look for material that will be of particular value to your audience . Do not settle for generalities , but search for specific points that are informative and truly helpful . Be realistic in the amount of research that you do . In most cases you will soon have more material than you can use , so you will need to be selective .

9 The counsel by Peter also applies to more serious aspects of life , such as a person ’ s choice of education , employment , or career . For example , young people in school today are under much pressure to qualify for enrollment in elite institutions of higher education . They are led to believe that advanced education opens the door to high-paying and prestigious jobs , and statistics are often presented to show the gap in earnings between graduates from such institutions and those who completed only basic schooling . Faced with choices that can deeply affect their entire life course , young people may find all of this very enticing . What should they and their parents bear in mind ?

6 Jehovah then said to me : “ Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem : ‘ Hear the words of this covenant , and carry them out . 7 For I solemnly admonished your forefathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt and to this day , admonishing them again and again : “ Obey my voice . ” 8 But they did not listen or incline their ear ; instead , each kept stubbornly following his own wicked heart . So I brought on them all the words of this covenant that I commanded them to do , but they refused to carry them out . ’ ”

4 What about modern times ? As we saw in the preceding chapter , secular powers have , at times , opposed Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . In this chapter , we will discuss some ways in which such governments have tried to restrict our way of worship . We will focus on three general areas : ( 1 ) our right to exist as an organization and to worship as we choose , ( 2 ) the freedom to choose medical treatment in harmony with Bible principles , and ( 3 ) the right of parents to raise children according to Jehovah ’ s standards . In each area , we will see how loyal citizens of the Messianic Kingdom have struggled valiantly to guard their precious citizenship and how their efforts have been blessed .
Look at us , please , for we are all your people .

That is what you should do for six days . 4 Have seven priests carry seven ram ’ s horns before the Ark . But on the seventh day , you should march around the city seven times and the priests should blow the horns . 5 When the ram ’ s horn is sounded—as soon as you hear the sound of the horn—all the people should shout a great war cry . Then the wall of the city will fall down flat , and the people must go up , each one straight ahead . ”

We must certainly avoid choosing to practice the serious sins that some in Corinth had been guilty of . That is vital if we are to say that we have accepted God ’ s undeserved kindness and that ‘ sin is not master over us . ’ However , are we also determined to be “ obedient from the heart ” by doing our best to avoid sins that some would view as less serious ? ( Rom . 6 :14 , 17 ) Think of the apostle Paul . We can be sure that he was not sharing in the gross wrongs mentioned at 1 Corinthians 6 :9-11 . Nonetheless , he confessed that he was still guilty of sin . He wrote : “ I am fleshly , sold under sin . For I do not understand what I am doing . For I do not practice what I wish , but I do what I hate . ” ( Rom . 7 :14 , 15 ) This shows that there were other things that Paul viewed as sins , and he was fighting against those wrongs too . ( Rom . 7 :21-23 ) May that also be true of us as we strive to be “ obedient from the heart . ” w16 .12 1 :15 , 16

Noah “ proved himself faultless among his contemporaries . ” ( Genesis 6 :9 ) Notice that the Bible says he was faultless among , not from the viewpoint of , his contemporaries . In other words , he was faultless in the eyes of God , but to the people of the pre-Flood world , Noah was odd . We can be sure that he did not agree with popular opinion , nor did he get involved in the ungodly entertainment and social activities of the day . Imagine how people viewed him when he began to build the ark ! They likely laughed at him , ridiculed him . They did not take him seriously .

Bible scholars acknowledge that God ’ s personal name , as represented by the Tetragrammaton ( יהוה ) , appears almost 7 ,000 times in the original text of the Hebrew Scriptures . However , many feel that it did not appear in the original text of the Christian Greek Scriptures . For this reason , most modern English Bibles do not use the name Jehovah when translating the so-called New Testament . Even when translating quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures in which the Tetragrammaton appears , most translators use “ Lord ” rather than God ’ s personal name .

It will solve all of mankind ’ s problems . For God ’ s Kingdom to bring about changes on the earth , however , there has to be a change from human rulership to the rulership of Christ . This is exactly what Christ ’ s coming will accomplish .

36 The family heads of the descendants of Gilʹe·ad the son of Maʹchir the son of Ma·nasʹseh of the families of the sons of Joseph approached and spoke before Moses and the chieftains , the family heads of the Israelites . 2 They said : “ Jehovah commanded my lord to distribute the land by lot as an inheritance to the Israelites ; and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of our brother Ze·loʹphe·had to his daughters . 3 If they marry men from another Israelite tribe , the women ’ s inheritance will also be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they would then belong , so that it would be withdrawn from the lot of our inheritance . 4 Now when the Jubilee takes place for the people of Israel , the women ’ s inheritance will also be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they then belong , so that their inheritance would be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers . ”

( Job 2 :3 ; 22 :3 ; 27 :5 ) We can fight the works of the Devil by encouraging members of our family and of the congregation . This will help to make our home and the Kingdom Hall places where we feel happy and secure .

17 Saul said to the people with him : “ Take a count , please , and see who has left us . ” When they took the count , they saw that Jonʹa·than and his armor-bearer were not there . 18 Saul now said to A·hiʹjah : “ Bring the Ark of the true God near ! ” ( For the Ark of the true God was with the Israelites at that time . ) 19 And while Saul was speaking to the priest , the turmoil in the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines was growing greater and greater . Then Saul said to the priest : “ Stop what you are doing . ” 20 So Saul and all the people with him assembled and went into the battle , where they found that the Phi·lisʹtines had turned their swords against one another , and the confusion was very great . 21 Also , the Hebrews who had previously sided with the Phi·lisʹtines and who had come up with them into the camp were going over to Israel under Saul and Jonʹa·than . 22 All the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im heard that the Phi·lisʹtines had fled , and they too joined in pursuing them in the battle . 23 So Jehovah saved Israel on that day , and the battle extended as far as Beth-aʹven .

18 How did such a course work out for Samuel ? We read : “ All the while the boy Samuel was growing bigger and more likable both from Jehovah ’ s standpoint and from that of men . ” ( 1 Sam . 2 :26 ) So Samuel was well-liked , at least by those whose opinions mattered . Jehovah himself cherished this boy for his faithful course . And Samuel surely knew that his God would act against all the badness going on in Shiloh , but perhaps he wondered when . One night , such questions met an answer .

9 All who are to be associated with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom must eventually die . But they well know the assurance that he gave when he said : “ I became dead , but , look ! I am living forever and ever , and I have the keys of death and of Hades . ” ( Revelation 1 :18 ) What did he mean ? He was calling attention to his own experience . He too had died . But God did not leave him in Hades . On the third day , Jehovah personally raised him to spirit life and conferred immortality upon him . ( Acts 2 :32 , 33 ; 10 :40 ) In addition , God gave him “ the keys of death and of Hades ” to use in releasing others from mankind ’ s common grave and from the effects of Adamic sin . Because he possesses those keys , Jesus is able to raise his faithful followers from the dead . He resurrects the spirit-anointed members of his congregation first , giving them the precious gift of immortal life in heaven , just as his Father gave him .—Romans 6 :5 ; Philippians 3 :20 , 21 .

8 There are other reasons why there is so much suffering in the world . After Adam and Eve rebelled , they passed sin on to their children . And because of sin , humans cause other humans to suffer . They often want to be more important than others . They fight , they go to war , and they bully others . ( Ecclesiastes 4 :1 ; 8 :9 ) Sometimes people suffer because of “ time and unexpected events . ” ( Ecclesiastes 9 :11 ) When they are in the wrong place at the wrong time , accidents and other bad things can happen to them .

If no return address is provided and literature is included , this too may give the wrong impression that the Society is the sender .

14 Another area that reveals the depth of our humility is our willingness to hear people out . James 1 :19 says that we should “ be quick to listen . ” Jehovah himself sets the superlative example in this regard . ( Gen . 18 :32 ; Josh . 10 :14 ) Consider what we can learn from the interchange recorded at Exodus 32 :11-14 . ( Read . ) Although not needing Moses ’ input , Jehovah gave Moses an opportunity to reveal how he felt . What human would listen at length to the reasoning of someone who has displayed faulty thinking and then act on that person ’ s word ? Yet , Jehovah listens patiently to humans who call on him in faith .

9 As he was passing along , he saw a man who had been blind from birth . 2 And his disciples asked him : “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , so that he was born blind ? ” 3 Jesus answered : “ Neither this man sinned nor his parents , but it was so that the works of God might be made manifest in his case . 4 We must do the works of the One who sent me while it is day ; the night is coming when no man can work . 5 As long as I am in the world , I am the world ’ s light . ” 6 After he said these things , he spat on the ground and made a paste with the saliva , and he smeared the paste on the man ’ s eyes 7 and said to him : “ Go wash in the pool of Si·loʹam ” ( which is translated “ Sent Forth ” ) .

21 So the king sent Je·huʹdi out to get the scroll , and he brought it from the chamber of E·lishʹa·ma the secretary . Je·huʹdi began to read it in the hearing of the king and of all the princes standing by the king . 22 The king was sitting in the winter house , in the ninth month , with a fire burning in the brazier before him . 23 After Je·huʹdi had read three or four columns , the king would cut off that portion with the secretary ’ s knife and pitch it into the fire that was burning in the brazier , until the entire scroll ended up in the fire that was in the brazier . 24 And they felt no dread ; neither the king nor all his servants who heard all these words ripped their garments apart . 25 Although El·naʹthan , De·laʹiah , and Gem·a·riʹah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll , he did not listen to them . 26 Further , the king commanded Je·rahʹme·el the son of the king , Se·raiʹah the son of Azʹri·el , and Shel·e·miʹah the son of Abʹde·el to seize Barʹuch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet , but Jehovah kept them concealed .

The Bible contains principles that teach us how Jehovah views life and blood . If we understand these principles , we will be able to make wise decisions and keep a good conscience . ( Proverbs 2 :6-11 ) Now , let ’ s examine some of those principles .

27 “ See , this is what I found , ” says the congregator . “ I investigated one thing after another to reach my conclusion , 28 but what I continually sought , I have not found . One man out of a thousand I found , but a woman among them I have not found . 29 This alone I have found : The true God made mankind upright , but they have sought out many schemes . ”

9 “ Then people will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you , and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name . 10 Then , too , many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another . 11 Many false prophets will arise and mislead many ; 12 and because of the increasing of lawlessness , the love of the greater number will grow cold . 13 But the one who has endured to the end will be saved . 14 And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations , and then the end will come .

19 Jesus told his disciples to expect tribulation . ( John 16 :33 ) In view of this , the words recorded at Acts 5 :29 have never been more timely : “ We must obey God as ruler rather than men . ” For that reason , these thrilling words have been selected as the yeartext of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses for 2006 . May it be our resolve during the coming year and throughout eternity to obey God as Ruler at all costs !
King David wrote : “ How long will I have anxious concern , with grief in my heart each day ? ” ( Psalm 13 :2 ) What helped David to cope ? He poured out his heart to God in prayer , trusting fully in God ’ s loyal love . ( Psalm 13 :5 ; 62 :8 ) In fact , God invites us to unburden ourselves to him . “ Throw all your anxiety on [ God ] , because he cares for you , ” says 1 Peter 5 :7 .
5 “ A woman must not put on the clothing of a man , nor should a man wear the clothing of a woman . For anyone doing so is detestable to Jehovah your God .

He is to pay the price to its owner , and the dead animal will become his . 35 If a man ’ s bull hurts another ’ s bull and it dies , then they must sell the live bull and divide the price paid for it ; they should also divide the dead animal . 36 Or if it was known that a bull had been in the habit of goring but its owner would not keep it under guard , he must make compensation with bull for bull , and the dead one will become his own .

7 Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in , not knowing what had happened . 8 Peter said to her : “ Tell me , did you two sell the field for so much ? ” She said : “ Yes , for that amount . ” 9 So Peter said to her : “ Why did you two agree to make a test of the spirit of Jehovah ? Look ! The feet of those who buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out . ” 10 Instantly she collapsed at his feet and died . When the young men came in , they found her dead and they carried her out and buried her alongside her husband . 11 So great fear came over the whole congregation and over all those hearing about these things .

Early Jewish writings indicate that Jewish Christians used the divine name in their writings . The Tosefta , a written collection of oral laws that was completed by about 300 C .E . , says with regard to Christian writings that were burned on the Sabbath : “ The books of the Evangelists and the books of the minim [ thought to be Jewish Christians ] they do not save from a fire . But they are allowed to burn where they are , they and the references to the Divine Name which are in them . ” This same source quotes Rabbi Yosé the Galilean , who lived at the beginning of the second century C .E . , as saying that on other days of the week , “ one cuts out the references to the Divine Name which are in them [ understood to refer to the Christian writings ] and stores them away , and the rest burns . ”

5 Of course , to be good teachers , we need knowledge of our subject and we need skill to impart that knowledge . Jesus helped his disciples to acquire both , and Jehovah , through his organization , helps us to do so today . ( Read Isaiah 54 :13 ; Luke 12 :42 . ) Still , we should aim to teach not only with our minds but also with our hearts . When knowledge , skill , and love work together , the results can be most satisfying . In what ways , then , can we show love when we teach ? How did Jesus and his disciples do so ? Let us see .
16 So when the Sabbath was over , Mary Magʹda·lene , Mary the mother of James , and Sa·loʹme bought spices in order to come and apply them to his body . 2 And very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen , they came to the tomb . 3 They were saying to one another : “ Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us ? ” 4 But when they looked up , they saw that the stone had been rolled away , although it was very large . 5 When they entered into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a white robe , and they were stunned . 6 He said to them : “ Do not be stunned . You are looking for Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ who was executed on the stake . He was raised up . He is not here . Look , here is the place where they laid him . 7 But go , tell his disciples and Peter , ‘ He is going ahead of you into Galʹi·lee . You will see him there , just as he told you . ’ ” 8 So when they came out , they fled from the tomb , trembling and overwhelmed with emotion . And they said nothing to anyone , for they were in fear .

25 Jesus , now noticing that a crowd was rushing toward them , rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it : “ You speechless and deaf spirit , I order you , get out of him and do not enter into him again ! ” 26 After crying out and going through many convulsions , it came out , and the child seemed to be dead , so that most of the people were saying : “ He is dead ! ” 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up , and he stood up . 28 So after he entered into a house , his disciples asked him privately : “ Why could we not expel it ? ” 29 He said to them : “ This kind can come out only by prayer . ”

15 On the seventh day they got up early , as soon as the dawn broke , and they marched around the city in the same manner seven times . It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times . 16 And on the seventh time , the priests blew the horns , and Joshua told the people : “ Shout , for Jehovah has given you the city ! 17 The city and everything in it is to be devoted to destruction ; it all belongs to Jehovah . Only Raʹhab the prostitute may keep living , she and all who are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers we sent out . 18 But keep away from what is devoted to destruction , so that you do not desire something devoted to destruction and take it , making the camp of Israel something devoted to destruction by bringing disaster on it . 19 But all the silver and the gold and the articles of copper and iron are holy to Jehovah .

14 Nevertheless , you did well to share with me in my tribulation . 15 In fact , you Phi·lipʹpi·ans also know that after you first learned the good news , when I departed from Mac·e·doʹni·a , not a congregation shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving , except you alone ; 16 for while I was in Thes·sa·lo·niʹca , you sent something to me for my need not just once but twice . 17 Not that I am looking for a gift , but I want the fruitage that brings more credit to your account . 18 However , I have everything I need and even more . I am fully supplied , now that I have received from E·paph·ro·diʹtus what you sent , a sweet fragrance , an acceptable sacrifice , well-pleasing to God . 19 In turn my God will fully supply all your need according to his riches in glory by means of Christ Jesus . 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever . Amen .

12 Like Jesus , his disciples loved and valued the truth about Jehovah and Christ so much that opposers could not discourage them from sharing it with others . Paul wrote to fellow Christians in Rome : “ There is eagerness on my part to declare the good news . . . For I am not ashamed of the good news ; it is , in fact , God ’ s power for salvation to everyone having faith . ” ( Rom . 1 :15 , 16 ) Paul considered it an honor to proclaim the truth . He wrote : “ To me , . . . this undeserved kindness was given , that I should declare to the nations the good news about the unfathomable riches of the Christ . ” ( Eph . 3 :8 ) It is not difficult to imagine Paul ’ s enthusiasm as he taught others about Jehovah and His purposes .

He did not do what was right in Jehovah ’ s eyes as David his forefather had done . 2 Instead , he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel , and he even made metal statues of the Baʹals . 3 Moreover , he made sacrificial smoke in the Valley of the Son of Hinʹnom and burned up his sons in the fire , following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the Israelites . 4 He also kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places , on the hills , and under every luxuriant tree .

Jephthah had no other child ; his daughter was his only hope for a descendant , someone to carry on his name and his inheritance in Israel . ( Judg . 11 :34 ) Nevertheless , Judges 11 :35 concludes with Jephthah saying : “ I have opened my mouth to Jehovah , and I am unable to turn back . ” His faithfulness even at great personal cost brought him God ’ s approval and blessing . Would you have made the same choice ? When we dedicated our lives to Jehovah , we vowed that we would do his will unreservedly . We knew that living up to that promise would require self-sacrifice . However , our willingness is especially put to the test when we are asked to do things that are not initially to our liking . When we make such sacrifices and serve God in a way that takes us out of our comfort zone , we prove ourselves faithful . The resulting blessings are always far greater than any sacrifices we may make , painful as they may be .—Mal . 3 :10 . w16 .04 1 :11 , 14 , 15
16 He handed them over to his servants , one drove after another , and he said to his servants : “ Cross over ahead of me , and you are to set a space between one drove and the next . ” 17 He also commanded the first one : “ In case Eʹsau my brother should meet you and ask , ‘ To whom do you belong , and where are you going , and to whom do these ahead of you belong ? ’ 18 then you should say , ‘ To your servant Jacob . It is a gift sent to my lord , to Eʹsau , and look ! he himself is also behind us . ’ ” 19 And he commanded also the second , the third , and all those following the droves : “ According to this word , you are to speak to Eʹsau when you meet him . 20 And you should also say , ‘ Here is your servant Jacob behind us . ’ ” For he said to himself : ‘ If I appease him by sending a gift ahead of me , then afterward when I see him , he may give me a kindly reception . ’ 21 So the gift crossed over ahead of him , but he himself spent the night in the camp .

12 One reason we should love Jehovah is that he requires us to reflect his qualities . God is both the source and the supreme example of love . “ God is love , ” wrote the inspired apostle John . ( 1 John 4 :8 ) Humans were created in God ’ s image ; we were designed to love . In fact , Jehovah ’ s sovereignty is based on love . He wants as his subjects those who serve him because they both love and desire his righteous way of ruling . Really , love is essential for the peace and harmony of all creation .

36 Then after dismissing the crowds , he went into the house . His disciples came to him and said : “ Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field . ” 37 In response he said : “ The sower of the fine seed is the Son of man ; 38 the field is the world . As for the fine seed , these are the sons of the Kingdom , but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one , 39 and the enemy who sowed them is the Devil . The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things , and the reapers are angels . 40 Therefore , just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire , so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things . 41 The Son of man will send his angels , and they will collect out from his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and people who practice lawlessness , 42 and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace . There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be . 43 At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father .

17 Samuel then called the people together to Jehovah at Mizʹpah 18 and said to the Israelites : “ This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says : ‘ It was I who brought Israel up out of Egypt and who rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you . 19 But today you have rejected your God who was your Savior out of all your evils and distresses , and you said : “ No , you should appoint a king over us . ” Now take your stand before Jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands . ’ ”
22 God ’ s Word offers this wise counsel : “ The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger , and it is beauty on his part to pass over transgression . ” ( Proverbs 19 :11 ) Insight is the ability to see beneath the surface , to look beyond the obvious . Insight nurtures understanding , for it can help us to discern why another person spoke or acted in a certain way . Endeavoring to grasp his genuine motives , feelings , and circumstances may help us to dispel negative thoughts and feelings toward him .

18 As a start to examining and applying Jesus ’ teachings , look at point 1 in the accompanying box . It refers to Matthew 5 :3-9 . Frankly , any of us could spend quite a while meditating on the wonderful counsel presented in those verses . Looking at them as a whole , though , what do you conclude about attitude ? If you truly want to overcome the effect of too much stress in your life , what is going to help ? How can you be affected for the better if you increase your attention to spiritual matters , letting such occupy more of your thoughts ? Is there some concern in your life that you need to attach less importance to , allowing for greater attention to spiritual issues ? If you do so , it will add to your happiness now .

No other kingdom had made anything like it . 20 All the drinking vessels of King Solʹo·mon were of gold , and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebʹa·non were of pure gold . There was nothing made of silver , for silver was considered as nothing in the days of Solʹo·mon . 21 For the king ’ s ships would go to Tarʹshish with the servants of Hiʹram .

The trial court agreed with him . It stated : “ The defendant . . . is able to support himself financially , and [ he ] has not received any economic benefit nor had any intentions to receive such , but instead his activities have caused him financial loss . ” Siding with the Witnesses , the court ruled that Lehmann ’ s activity could not “ be characterized as trade . ” The adversaries of God ’ s people , though , were determined to restrain the preaching work throughout the land .

12 Effective illustrations can also strengthen a child ’ s faith in the accuracy of the Bible . For example , consider Job 26 :7 . ( Read . ) How might you show that this scripture was inspired ? You could just state facts . Instead , why not stimulate your child ’ s imagination ? Bring up the fact that Job lived long before telescopes and spaceships . Your child ’ s job could be to show how difficult it might be for some to believe that a very large object , such as the earth , could sit on nothing . The child could use a ball or a stone to illustrate the point by showing that objects with mass have to rest on something . Such a lesson would impress on your child that Jehovah had facts recorded in the Bible long before humans could prove them .—Neh . 9 :6 .

Why do you mistreat each other ? ’ 27 But the one who was mistreating his neighbor pushed him away , saying : ‘ Who appointed you ruler and judge over us ? 28 You do not want to do away with me the way you did away with the Egyptian yesterday , do you ? ’ 29 On hearing this , Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midʹi·an , where he became the father of two sons .

They were also watching the gates closely both day and night in order to do away with him . 25 So his disciples took him and let him down by night through an opening in the wall , lowering him in a basket .

7 The Bible is no mere collection of unrelated Jewish and Christian literature . Rather , it is a well-organized book—a divinely inspired masterpiece . The individual books of the Bible are interconnected . Interwoven from Genesis to Revelation is the Bible ’ s central theme—the vindication of Jehovah ’ s sovereignty and the fulfillment of his purpose for the earth by means of his Kingdom under Christ , the promised “ offspring . ” —Read Genesis 3 :15 ; Matthew 6 :10 ; Revelation 11 :15 .

FOR many people in today ’ s world , work is anything but a pleasure . Laboring long hours at a job that they do not particularly enjoy , they dread going to work each day . How can those with such a mind-set be motivated to take a personal interest in their work—let alone find satisfaction in their job ?
And that you have afflicted me in your faithfulness .

The descriptive names given to Satan ( Resister , Slanderer , Deceiver , Tempter , Liar ) do not imply that he has the ability to search our hearts and minds . By way of contrast , however , Jehovah is described as “ the examiner of hearts , ” and Jesus , as the one who “ searches the innermost thoughts and hearts . ” —Proverbs 17 :3 ; Revelation 2 :23 .

3 Nevertheless , most people take the sun for granted , even though their lives depend on it . Thus , they miss what the sun can teach us . The Bible says of Jehovah : “ You . . . prepared the luminary , even the sun . ” ( Psalm 74 :16 ) Yes , the sun brings honor to Jehovah , “ the Maker of heaven and earth . ” ( Psalm 19 :1 ; 146 :6 ) It is just one of countless heavenly bodies that teach us about Jehovah ’ s immense creative power . Let us examine some of these more closely and then turn our attention to the earth and the life that thrives upon it .

I will not remove my loyal love from him the way I removed it from the one who was prior to you . 14 I will cause him to stand in my house and in my kingship forever , and his throne will last forever . ” ’ ”

7 Surely you know that it is those who adhere to faith who are sons of Abraham . 8 Now the scripture , foreseeing that God would declare people of the nations righteous through faith , declared the good news beforehand to Abraham , namely : “ By means of you all the nations will be blessed . ” 9 So those who adhere to faith are being blessed together with Abraham , who had faith .

17 Because a pure heart is morally and spiritually clean , it does not dwell on things that are unclean in Jehovah ’ s eyes . ( 1 Chron . 28 :9 ; Isa . 52 :11 ) If we are pure in heart , what we say and do will have the mark of purity , and there will be nothing hypocritical about our service to Jehovah .

8 We read at Ephesians 6 :12 : “ We have a struggle [ “ wrestling , ” footnote ] . . . against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places . ” Each Christian personally has a fight against the Devil and the demons .

On the one side , it was a dark cloud . On the other side , it was lighting up the night . So the one camp did not come near the other camp all night long .
11 Human imperfection and death involve both the sin Adam committed and Jehovah ’ s righteous judgment . ( Rom . 5 :12 , 16 ) We read : “ Through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation . ” ( Rom . 5 :18 ) What could Jehovah do to remove his condemnatory judgment without invalidating his own standards ? We find the answer in Jesus ’ words : “ The Son of man came . . . to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many . ” ( Matt . 20 :28 ) The one who was Jehovah ’ s first spirit son made clear that he , having been born on earth as a perfect human , would provide a ransom .

16 Demonstrating his trust , Jesus delegated various responsibilities to his disciples . On the two occasions when he miraculously multiplied food and fed the crowds , he delegated to his disciples the responsibility of distributing the food . ( Matthew 14 :19 ; 15 :36 ) In preparation for his final Passover , he assigned Peter and John to go to Jerusalem and get things ready . They took care of obtaining the lamb , wine , unleavened bread , bitter greens , and any other necessary items . This was no menial assignment , for celebrating the Passover in the proper manner was a requirement of the Mosaic Law , and Jesus had to live up to that Law . Besides , later that evening Jesus used the wine and the unleavened bread as important symbols when instituting the Memorial of his death .—Matthew 26 :17-19 ; Luke 22 :8 , 13 .

And they led him out to nail him to the stake . 21 Also , they compelled into service a passerby , a certain Simon of Cy·reʹne , coming from the countryside , the father of Alexander and Ruʹfus , to carry his torture stake .

2 Jehovah ’ s words were most reassuring : “ You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians , that I might carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself . ” ( Exodus 19 :4 ) Jehovah reminded his people that he had delivered them from the Egyptians , using eagles , as it were , to carry them to safety . But there are other reasons why “ wings of eagles ” fittingly illustrate divine protection .

19 The love we show is noted by others . For instance , a pioneer sister in the United States writes letters to comfort those who have lost loved ones in death . In reply , one man wrote : “ My first reaction was one of surprise that a person would put such effort into writing a letter to a total stranger in order to help him endure trying times . I can only conclude that you have a love for your fellow man and for the God who guides him along the paths of life . ”

The apostle Peter wrote those words to encourage Christians to endure the hardships heaped on them by Satan . The experiences of “ those who have endured ” teach us how to remain steadfast and remind us that our faithful course will be rewarded . ( Jas . 5 :11 ) Perhaps you face bitter opposition , even persecution , from enemies of true worship . Or you are a congregation elder or a circuit overseer who feels the weight of your heavy responsibilities . Meditate on the example of Paul . He faced numerous “ things of an external kind ” by vicious persecutors , and he felt daily pressure on account of his anxiety for the congregations . ( 2 Cor . 11 :23-29 ) Yet , he refused to give up , and his example strengthened others . ( 2 Cor . 1 :6 ) When you endure hardship , remember that your example is likely encouraging others to endure . w16 .04 2 :11 , 14

14 Most differences between Christians can and should be resolved privately by the individuals concerned . However , Jesus noted that some situations might require congregation involvement . ( Read Matthew 18 :15-17 . ) What would be the outcome if an offender refused to listen to his brother , to witnesses , and to the congregation ? He should be treated “ just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector . ” Today , we would say that he should be disfellowshipped . The seriousness of this step indicates that the “ sin ” was not a small disagreement . Rather , it was ( 1 ) a sin that could be settled between the individuals concerned but it was also ( 2 ) a sin serious enough to merit disfellowshipping if not settled . Such sins might involve a measure of fraud or might include damaging a person ’ s reputation through slander . The three steps Jesus outlined here are applicable only where these conditions exist . The offense did not include such a sin as adultery , homosexuality , apostasy , idolatry , or some other gross sin definitely requiring the attention of the congregation elders .
Some months before this incident at school , our family had moved to live near Glasgow in Scotland .

7 Before we can cultivate love for Jehovah in others , we must know and love him ourselves . After all , true worship is based on love for God . ( Matt . 22 :36-38 ) Jesus set a perfect example . He loved Jehovah with his whole heart , mind , soul , and strength . Having spent perhaps billions of years in heaven with his heavenly Father , Jesus knew him well . The result ? “ I love the Father , ” Jesus said . ( John 14 :31 ) That love was reflected in everything Jesus said and did . It motivated him always to do the things pleasing to God . ( John 8 :29 ) It impelled him to denounce the religious leaders , who hypocritically claimed to represent God . It also moved him to speak about Jehovah and to help others to know and love God .

12 Imagine that you gave a valuable gift to a friend . How disappointed you would be if you learned that he had thrown your gift in the trash or , worse yet , that he had used it to injure someone ! Now think of how Jehovah must feel as he watches so many people misuse their freedom to make choices in life even to the harm of others . Indeed , just as the Bible foretold , during “ the last days ” men would be “ unthankful . ” ( 2 Tim . 3 :1 , 2 ) May we never misuse this precious gift from Jehovah or take it for granted . How , though , can we avoid misusing our gift of free will ?

16 Unwarranted anxiety often results if a Christian agonizes over possible future problems . However , you need not be consumed by anxiety , or worry , over events that you do not know anything about . Why not ? Because things often do not turn out to be as bad as we feared they might be . Moreover , there is no situation beyond the control of the God on whom you can throw all your anxiety . His very name is understood to mean “ He Causes to Become . ” ( Ex . 3 :14 ) The profound meaning of the divine name assures us that God is fully capable of seeing to it that his purposes in behalf of his servants are carried out . You can be certain that God can reward his faithful ones and help them deal with anxiety about the past , the present , and the future .

Although the apostle Paul searched in synagogues for those who already knew something about God , he certainly did not restrict his efforts to Jewish people . The responses he received from those who worshipped other deities would test the depth of his humility .

21 The Bible gives a powerful reason for us to “ cleanse ourselves of every defilement . ” Notice that 2 Corinthians 7 :1 begins by saying : “ Since we have these promises . ” What promises ? As mentioned in the preceding verses , Jehovah promises : “ I will take you in . And I will become a father to you . ” ( 2 Corinthians 6 :17 , 18 ) Just imagine : Jehovah promises to put you under his protective care and to love you as a father does a son or a daughter . But Jehovah will fulfill these promises only if you avoid defilements of “ flesh and spirit . ” How foolish it would be , then , to allow any disgusting habit or practice to rob you of such a precious and close relationship with Jehovah !
6 As holy spirit operates upon you , you manifest godly qualities , “ the fruitage of the spirit . ” ( Gal . 5 :22 , 23 ) You realize , though , that this calls for effort on your part . To illustrate : A farmer cultivates the land . Of course , sunshine and water are necessary ; without such he can not expect any harvest . We might compare holy spirit to sunshine . Holy spirit is needed for us to manifest the fruitage of the spirit . Yet , what would be produced without the farmer ’ s hard work ? ( Prov . 10 :4 ) Yes , how you cultivate the soil of your heart makes a difference in the quality and quantity of the fruitage of the holy spirit in you . So ask yourself , ‘ Am I permitting holy spirit to produce its fruitage by working along with it ? ’

10 Some individuals may feel that since choices in these matters are personal , they should have the freedom to choose what they please as long as their conscience permits it . Perhaps they have in mind Paul ’ s words to the Corinthian Christians about food : “ Why should my freedom be judged by another person ’ s conscience ? ” ( 1 Cor . 10 :29 ) While it is true that we have the freedom to make personal choices regarding our education and career , we need to remember that our freedom is relative and that all decisions we make have consequences . For that reason , Paul prefaced his statement with these words : “ All things are lawful [ or , “ permissible , ” ftn . ] , but not all things are advantageous . All things are lawful , but not all things build up . ” ( 1 Cor . 10 :23 ) That certainly helps us to see that there are far more important factors to consider than our own preferences when it comes to exercising personal freedom in all aspects of our life .

10 To illustrate : Imagine a married woman who is shopping . She sees a pair of shoes that she would like to have , but they are very expensive . So she asks herself , ‘ How would my husband feel about my spending that much money ? ’ Likely , she already knows the answer , even though her husband is not with her . Why does she know ? Because over a period of time , she has become familiar with his way of thinking about their limited budget . As a result , she perceives what her husband ’ s thoughts on such a purchase would be . In a comparable way , as we become progressively acquainted with Jehovah ’ s thoughts and ways , we improve in our ability to perceive what our heavenly Father would want us to do in various circumstances .

14 Those who are pure in heart can enjoy a clean and happy standing before Jehovah , who declared : “ Happy are those who wash their robes . ” ( Rev . 22 :14 ) In what sense do they “ wash their robes ” ? Anointed Christians “ wash their robes ” in that they are clean in Jehovah ’ s eyes and will be granted immortal life and enjoy endless happiness in their heavenly position . The great crowd who hope to live on earth can also enjoy a righteous standing as friends of God . They are even now ‘ washing their robes and making them white in the blood of the Lamb . ’ —Rev . 7 :9 , 13 , 14 .

21 Among the precious treasures filling a happy household are such qualities as true love , godly fear , and firm faith . ( Proverbs 15 :16 , 17 ; 1 Peter 1 :7 ) They create a strong marriage . But did you note how the rooms in the above-quoted proverb are filled with precious treasures ? “ By knowledge . ” Yes , when applied , Bible knowledge has the power to transform people ’ s thinking and to move them to rekindle their love for each other . ( Romans 12 :2 ; Philippians 1 :9 ) Hence , whenever you and your spouse sit down together and calmly consider a Bible passage , such as the daily text , or a Bible-based article in The Watchtower or Awake ! pertaining to marriage , it is as if you were examining a lovely decoration that can beautify your house . When love for Jehovah moves you to apply in your marriage the counsel that you just examined , you are , as it were , bringing that decoration into the rooms of your house . As a result , some of the color and warmth that you once enjoyed in your marriage may return .

Millions of modern-day worshippers of God are following the example of Jesus by keeping their hope in clear focus and not allowing trials to weaken their faith . Consider the example of Rudolf Graichen , who was born in Germany in 1925 . He recalled pictures of Bible scenes that hung on the walls of his home . “ One picture , ” he wrote , “ showed the wolf and the lamb , the kid and the leopard , the calf and the lion—all in peace , being led by a little boy . . . . Such pictures made a lasting impression on me . ” ( Isa . 11 :6-9 ) Despite many years of cruel persecution , first by the Nazi Gestapo and later by the Communist Stasi of East Germany , Rudolf maintained his strong faith in an earthly paradise . Other severe trials faced by Rudolf were the loss of his beloved mother , who died of typhus in the Ravensbrück concentration camp , and seeing his father weaken in faith and renounce being one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . w16 .10 3 :12-14

20 Jehovah rewards his faithful servants with life , but life of what kind ? Well , are you really living now ? Most of us would say that the answer is obvious . After all , we breathe , we eat , and we drink . Surely we must be living . And in our happier moments , we may even say , “ Now this is really living ! ” However , the Bible indicates that in an important sense , no human today is really living .

12 Satan tries to confuse the thinking of people . He gradually creates doubts , until people think that “ good is bad and bad is good . ” ( Isaiah 5 :20 ) The Devil promotes the idea that the Bible ’ s counsel does not work and that we would be happier if we ignored God ’ s standards .
“ Let the beloved one of Jehovah reside in security by him ;

Declaring the good news of the Kingdom was Jesus ’ primary assignment . However , he took time to train others to be shepherds and teachers . ( Matt . 10 :5-7 ) Although Philip was busy as an evangelizer , he no doubt helped his four daughters to become effective in sharing Scriptural truths with others . ( Acts 21 :8 , 9 ) How important is such training today ? Worldwide , the number of people accepting the good news is growing . New ones who are not yet baptized need to grasp the importance of personal Bible study . They must also be taught to preach the good news to others and to teach them the truth . In our congregations , brothers need to be encouraged to work hard in order to qualify for appointment as ministerial servants and elders . By means of “ good instruction , ” mature Christians can help new ones to make spiritual progress . w16 .08 4 :1 , 2
212 37 Main Points Made to Stand Out
10 At times , some Christians have felt that they would rather marry someone who does not worship Jehovah than be alone . But if we ignore Bible counsel , the result is often pain and unhappiness . As Jehovah ’ s worshippers , serving him is the most important thing in our life . How would you feel if you could not share that most important part of your life with your mate ? Many have decided to stay single rather than marry a person who does not love and serve Jehovah .—Read Psalm 32 :8 .

8 Moses hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself . 9 Then he said : “ If , now , I have found favor in your eyes , O Jehovah , then please , Jehovah , go along with us in our midst , although we are an obstinate people , and forgive our error and our sin , and take us as your own possession . ” 10 In turn he said : “ Here I am making a covenant : Before all your people , I will do wonderful things that have never been done in all the earth or among all the nations , and all the people among whom you live will see the work of Jehovah , for it is an awe-inspiring thing that I am doing with you .
6 So Samuel said to the people : “ Jehovah , who used Moses and Aaron and who brought your forefathers up out of the land of Egypt , is a witness . 7 And now take your positions , and I will judge you before Jehovah in view of all the righteous acts that Jehovah has done for you and for your forefathers .
8 Jesus was granted still more authority in 1914 . In that year he was appointed as King of Jehovah ’ s Messianic Kingdom . When Jesus ’ rule began , “ war broke out in heaven . ” The result ? Satan and his demons were hurled to the earth , triggering an era of woe . The rampant wars , crime , terror , disease , earthquakes , and famines that have afflicted modern man remind us that Jesus is ruling in heaven right now . Satan is still “ the ruler of this world ” for “ a short period of time . ” ( Revelation 12 :7-12 ; John 12 :31 ; Matthew 24 :3-7 ; Luke 21 :11 ) However , Jesus is giving people worldwide the opportunity to accept His rulership .

28 So Jehovah said to Moses : “ How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws ? 29 Take notice of the fact that Jehovah has given you the Sabbath . That is why he is giving you the bread for two days on the sixth day . Everyone must stay where he is ; nobody is to leave his locality on the seventh day . ” 30 So the people observed the Sabbath on the seventh day .

17 What else did the Christians in Ephesus need to do ? They lived in a city full of demonism . So Paul told them : “ Carry on prayer on every occasion . ” ( Ephesians 6 :18 ) They needed to ask Jehovah for his protection at all times . What about us ? We also live in a world that is full of demonism . So we too need to ask Jehovah for his protection , and we need to use his name when we pray . ( Read Proverbs 18 :10 . ) If we keep on asking Jehovah to deliver us from Satan , Jehovah will answer our prayers .—Psalm 145 :19 ; Matthew 6 :13 .
Ps 119 :97 How I do love your l . !
3 What will help us to make wise decisions ? We certainly need faith in God , not doubting his willingness and ability to help us to be wise . We also need faith in Jehovah ’ s Word and in his way of doing things , trusting God ’ s inspired counsel . ( Read James 1 :5-8 . ) As we draw close to him and grow in love for his Word , we come to trust his judgment . Accordingly , we develop the habit of consulting God ’ s Word before making decisions . But how can we improve our decision-making skills ? And does being willing to decide mean sticking to our choices no matter what ?

7 To obtain a good harvest , farmers also need to water their crops . In order to cultivate the fruitage of the spirit , you need the waters of truth found in the Bible and available through the Christian congregation today . ( Isa . 55 :1 ) You have likely pointed out to many people that the Holy Scriptures are a product of holy spirit . ( 2 Tim . 3 :16 ) Also , the faithful and discreet slave class provides much-needed understanding of the pure waters of Bible truth . ( Matt . 24 :45-47 ) The implication is clear . In order to come under the influence of the holy spirit , we must read and meditate on God ’ s Word . If you are doing that , you are imitating the fine examples of the prophets who made “ a diligent inquiry and a careful search ” of information that was provided . It is noteworthy that even the angels have shown deep interest in spiritual truths regarding the promised Seed and the anointed Christian congregation .—Read 1 Peter 1 :10-12 .

It will be better than anything we can imagine ! Satan , his demons , and all wickedness will be gone . You will not get sick , and you will not die . Instead , you will wake up each day full of energy and happy to be alive . Everyone will work together to make the earth into a paradise . All will have good food and a safe place to live . People will not be cruel or violent but will be genuinely kind to one another . In time , all humans on earth will enjoy “ the glorious freedom of the children of God . ” —Romans 8 :21 .

As noted in paragraph 11 , this second event is the gathering of the remaining ones of the anointed remnant .

Go and bring back the young man Abʹsa·lom . ” 22 At this Joʹab fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and praised the king . Joʹab said : “ Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes , O my lord the king , because the king has acted on the request of his servant . ” 23 Then Joʹab got up and went to Geshʹur and brought Abʹsa·lom to Jerusalem . 24 However , the king said : “ Let him return to his own house , but he may not see my face . ” So Abʹsa·lom returned to his own house , and he did not see the face of the king .
“ The sacred secret of . . . godly devotion ” was also revealed in Jesus . ( 1 Timothy 3 :16 ) It had long been a secret , a mystery , as to whether anyone could maintain perfect integrity to Jehovah . Jesus revealed the answer . He kept integrity under every test that Satan put upon him .—Matthew 4 :1-11 ; 27 :26-50 .
Attack cut short
14 Jesus found joy in every one of his assignments , and we can find joy in ours . ( Prov . 8 :30 , 31 ) A modest person does not feel cramped by his current assignments or responsibilities in the congregation . He does not worry about gaining future privileges or about what others are achieving . Instead , he focuses his energies on finding purpose and enjoyment in his present role because he views it as coming from Jehovah . At the same time , he sincerely respects the role or place that Jehovah has given to others . Modesty helps us to enjoy giving others due honor and support .—Rom . 12 :10 .

For the land is still at our disposal , because we have searched for Jehovah our God . We have searched , and he has given us rest all around . ” So their building was successful .

13 A Christian ’ s heart is important , for we are commanded to love Jehovah with our whole heart and to love our neighbor as ourselves . ( Matt . 22 :37-39 ) But the Scriptural passages cited in the preceding paragraph highlight the danger of letting emotions dictate our thinking and actions . For example , what might happen if we make decisions when we are angry ? The answer may be obvious if we have done this in times past . ( Prov . 14 :17 ; 29 :22 ) Or is it likely that we will make sound decisions when we are discouraged ? ( Num . 32 :6-12 ; Prov . 24 :10 ) Bear in mind that God ’ s Word shows the wisdom of being “ a slave to God ’ s law . ” ( Rom . 7 :25 ) Clearly , we could easily be deceived by our emotions if we allow them to prevail when we are making important decisions .

Jehovah cares for those who love him . By means of his Word , the Bible , he maps out the best path for them . We read : “ I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go . I will give advice with my eye upon you . ” So before you take the first step down any road , it is wise to seek Jehovah ’ s advice , as did King David of ancient Israel , who prayed : “ Make known to me the way in which I should walk . ” —Psalm 32 :8 ; 143 :8 .

The apostle John warned that if anyone loves the things in the world— “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one ’ s means of life ” —then “ the love of the Father is not in him . ” ( 1 John 2 :15 , 16 ) This means that we need to examine our heart constantly to see if it is being enticed by worldly entertainment , associations , and styles of dress and grooming . Or the love of the world might involve efforts to attain “ great things , ” such as through the pursuit of higher education . We stand at the threshold of the promised new world . Thus , how important it is that we keep well in mind Moses ’ powerful words at Deuteronomy 6 :4 ! If we clearly understand and firmly believe that “ Jehovah our God is one Jehovah , ” we will do all we can to give him exclusive devotion , serving him as he approves .—Heb . 12 :28 , 29 . w16 .06 3 :14

The one whom God pronounces guilty is to make double compensation to his fellow man .

11 In the book of Daniel , we read about the Hebrew youths Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . They demonstrated their exclusive devotion to Jehovah not only by abstaining from eating foods that were unclean but also by refusing to bow down to Nebuchadnezzar ’ s golden image . Their priorities were clear ; there was no room in their worship for compromise .—Dan . 1 :1–3 :30 .
18 After journeying from Padʹdan-aʹram , Jacob arrived safely at the city of Sheʹchem in the land of Caʹnaan , and he set up his camp near the city . 19 Then he acquired a portion of the field where he pitched his tent from the sons of Haʹmor , the father of Sheʹchem , for 100 pieces of money . 20 There he set up an altar and called it God , the God of Israel .
11 Jehovah knew from the beginning that mankind ’ s independence , or self-rule , would result in much suffering . Was it unjust of him , then , to allow the inevitable to run its course ? Not at all ! To illustrate : Suppose you have a child who needs surgery to cure a life-threatening ailment . You realize that the operation will cause your child a degree of suffering , and this deeply grieves you . At the same time , you know that the procedure will enable your child to enjoy better health later in life . Similarly , God knew—and even foretold—that his allowance of human rule would bring along with it a measure of pain and suffering . ( Genesis 3 :16-19 ) But he also knew that lasting and meaningful relief would be possible only if he allowed all mankind to see the bad fruitage produced by rebellion . In this way the issue could be settled permanently , for all eternity .

26 Thus David the son of Jesʹse reigned over all Israel , 27 and the length of his reign over Israel was 40 years . In Hebʹron he reigned for 7 years , and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years . 28 And he died at a good old age , satisfied with long life , wealth , and glory ; and his son Solʹo·mon became king in his place . 29 As for the history of King David , from beginning to end , it is written among the words of Samuel the seer , Nathan the prophet , and Gad the visionary , 30 together with all his kingship , his mightiness , and the events of the times involving him and Israel and all the surrounding kingdoms .
2 My little children , I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin . And yet , if anyone does commit a sin , we have a helper with the Father , Jesus Christ , a righteous one . 2 And he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins , yet not for ours only but also for the whole world ’ s . 3 And by this we realize that we have come to know him , namely , if we continue observing his commandments . 4 The one who says , “ I have come to know him , ” and yet does not observe his commandments is a liar , and the truth is not in this person . 5 But whoever does observe his word , in this person the love of God has truly been made perfect . By this we know that we are in union with him . 6 The one who says he remains in union with him is himself under obligation to go on walking just as that one walked .

( Deut . 10 :17-19 ; Mal . 3 :5 , 6 ) If we reflect on the challenges that they are facing , such as discrimination or the language barrier , we will look for ways to show them kindness and fellow feeling .—1 Pet . 3 :8 .
‘ As a literary historian I am perfectly convinced that whatever the Gospels are , they are not legends . They are not artistic enough to be legends . Most of the life of Jesus is unknown to us , and no people building up a legend would allow that to be so . ’ —C . S . Lewis , God in the Dock .
26 As they continued eating , Jesus took a loaf , and after saying a blessing , he broke it , and giving it to the disciples , he said : “ Take , eat . This means my body . ” 27 And taking a cup , he offered thanks and gave it to them , saying : “ Drink out of it , all of you , 28 for this means my ‘ blood of the covenant , ’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins . 29 But I say to you : I will by no means drink again any of this product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father . ” 30 Finally , after singing praises , they went out to the Mount of Olives .

12 “ I am the light of the world . ” ( Read John 8 :12 ; 9 :5 . ) Long before Jesus ’ birth on earth , the prophet Isaiah foretold : “ The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light . As for those dwelling in the land of deep shadow , light itself has shone upon them . ” ( Isa . 9 :2 ) The apostle Matthew explained that Jesus fulfilled that prophecy when He commenced preaching and said : “ Repent , you people , for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near . ” ( Matt . 4 :16 , 17 ) Jesus ’ ministry brought to the people spiritual enlightenment and freedom from enslavement to false religious teachings . “ I have come as a light into the world , ” said Jesus , “ in order that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness . ” —John 1 :3-5 ; 12 :46 .

25 However , Abraham complained to A·bimʹe·lech about the well of water that the servants of A·bimʹe·lech had violently seized . 26 A·bimʹe·lech replied : “ I do not know who did this ; you did not tell me about it , and I heard nothing about it until today . ” 27 At that Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to A·bimʹe·lech , and the two of them made a covenant . 28 When Abraham set seven female lambs apart from the flock by themselves , 29 A·bimʹe·lech said to Abraham : “ Why have you set these seven female lambs here by themselves ? ” 30 Then he said : “ You are to accept the seven female lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well . ” 31 That is why he called that place Beʹer-sheʹba , because there both of them had taken an oath . 32 So they made a covenant at Beʹer-sheʹba , after which A·bimʹe·lech got up together with Phiʹcol the chief of his army , and they returned to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines . 33 After that he planted a tamarisk tree at Beʹer-sheʹba , and there he called on the name of Jehovah , the everlasting God . 34 And Abraham stayed in the land of the Phi·lisʹtines for a long time .

18 And still another angel emerged from the altar , and he had authority over the fire . And he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle , saying : “ Put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , for its grapes have become ripe . ” 19 The angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth , and he hurled it into the great winepress of God ’ s anger . 20 The winepress was trodden outside the city , and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1 ,600 stadia .

He did not depart from all the sins that Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat had caused Israel to commit . 25 He restored the boundary of Israel from Leʹbo-haʹmath clear to the Sea of the Arʹa·bah , according to the word that Jehovah the God of Israel spoke through his servant Joʹnah the son of A·mitʹtai , the prophet from Gath-heʹpher . 26 For Jehovah had seen the very bitter affliction of Israel . There was no one left to help Israel , not even the helpless or the weak . 27 But Jehovah had promised not to wipe out the name of Israel from under the heavens . So he saved them by the hand of Jer·o·boʹam the son of Je·hoʹash .

18 In Jehovah ’ s eyes , how serious is adultery ? The Mosaic Law helps us to appreciate Jehovah ’ s feelings on the matter . In Israel , adultery and idolatry were among the offenses that carried the death penalty . ( Leviticus 20 :2 , 10 ) Can you see a similarity between the two ? Well , an Israelite worshipping an idol broke his covenant with Jehovah . Similarly , an Israelite committing adultery broke his covenant with his spouse . Both acted treacherously . ( Exodus 19 :5 , 6 ; Deuteronomy 5 :9 ; read Malachi 2 :14 . ) Hence , both were reprehensible before Jehovah , the faithful and trustworthy God .—Psalm 33 :4 .

He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of Jehovah . 3 The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before Jehovah , that he would follow Jehovah and keep his commandments , his reminders , and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul by carrying out the words of this covenant that were written in this book . And all the people agreed to the covenant .

5 Jehovah is also unique in his goodness . Not long before Jesus died , a man approached him to ask a question , addressing him with the words “ Good Teacher . ” Jesus replied : “ Why do you call me good ? Nobody is good , except one , God . ” ( Mark 10 :17 , 18 ) Now , that response may strike you as puzzling . Why would Jesus correct the man ? Was not Jesus , in fact , a “ Good Teacher ” ?

Afterward , she tied the scarlet cord in the window . 22 So they left and went to the mountainous region and stayed there for three days , until the pursuers returned . The pursuers had been looking for them on every road but did not find them . 23 The two men then descended from the mountainous region and crossed the river and came to Joshua the son of Nun . They related to him all the things that had happened to them . 24 Then they said to Joshua : “ Jehovah has handed over the entire land to us . In fact , all the inhabitants of the land are disheartened because of us . ”

6 Satan the Devil wants to discourage us because he knows that discouragement can make us weak spiritually and in other ways . “ If you become discouraged in the day of distress , ” says Proverbs 24 :10 , “ your strength will be meager . ” Satan used a combination of calamities and accusations in an effort to discourage righteous Job , but that cruel scheme failed . ( Job 2 :3 ; 22 :3 ; 27 :5 ) We can fight the works of the Devil by encouraging members of our family and of the congregation . This will help to make our home and the Kingdom Hall places where we feel happy and secure .

An experienced traveler wants to know where each road leads . He may consult a map and talk to people who know the area . He will certainly take note of signposts he encounters along the way . On life ’ s journey , though , how can you be sure which is the best path to take ? Regarding the people of ancient Israel , God once said through Moses : “ O that they were wise ! Then they would ponder over this . They would consider their end afterward . ” —Deuteronomy 32 :29 .
13 Consider the work of the true God , for who can straighten out what he has made crooked ? 14 On a good day , reflect this goodness , but on the day of adversity , consider that God made the one as well as the other , so that men can not be certain of anything that will happen to them in the future .
8 “ At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Leʹvi to carry the ark of Jehovah ’ s covenant , to stand before Jehovah in order to minister to him , and to bless in his name , as they do to this day . 9 That is why Leʹvi has no share or inheritance with his brothers . Jehovah is his inheritance , just as Jehovah your God had said to him . 10 I myself stayed on the mountain as I did the first time , 40 days and 40 nights , and Jehovah listened to me on that occasion also . Jehovah did not want to destroy you . 11 Then Jehovah said to me , ‘ Go ahead of the people , and prepare to depart , so that they may go in and take possession of the land that I have sworn to their forefathers to give to them . ’

Paul began with the confident statement that Christ died for our sins , was buried , and was resurrected . What made Paul so sure of that ? One reason was the testimony of many eyewitnesses . The resurrected Jesus appeared to individuals ( including Paul himself ) , to small groups , and even to a crowd of 500 , many of whom had no doubt been skeptical when they heard the news that Jesus had been resurrected ! ( Luke 24 :1-11 ) Most of the eyewitnesses were still alive in Paul ’ s day and could be consulted to confirm those appearances . ( 1 Corinthians 15 :6 ) One or two witnesses might be easy to dismiss , but not the testimony of 500 or more eyewitnesses .
5 And I saw in the right hand of the One seated on the throne a scroll written on both sides , sealed tight with seven seals . 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice : “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? ” 3 But no one in heaven or on earth or underneath the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it . 4 I gave way to a great deal of weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it . 5 But one of the elders said to me : “ Stop weeping . Look ! The Lion of the tribe of Judah , the root of David , has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals . ”

14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Sa·marʹi·a had accepted the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ; 15 and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit . 16 For it had not yet come upon any one of them , but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . 17 Then they laid their hands on them , and they began to receive holy spirit .

17 A fourth way to help you cope with anxiety is good communication , sharing your feelings with a trusted confidant . A marriage mate , a close friend , or a congregation elder may be able to help you to put your anxiety into perspective . “ Anxiety in a man ’ s heart weighs it down , but a good word cheers it up . ” ( Prov . 12 :25 ) Frank and honest communication can do much to help you to understand and deal with your concerns .

6 When Brother Charles Taze Russell began searching for the truth from God ’ s Word , he saw the need to meet with others who had the same goal . In 1879 , Russell wrote : “ I , in company with others in Pittsburgh , organized and maintained a bible class for the searching of the Scriptures , meeting every Sunday . ” Readers of Zion ’ s Watch Tower were encouraged to meet together , and by 1881 , meetings were being held in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , every Sunday and Wednesday . The November 1895 issue of the Watch Tower said that the purpose of those meetings was to cultivate “ Christian fellowship , love and communion ” and to give the opportunity to those attending to encourage one another .—Read Hebrews 10 :24 , 25 .

If you succeed in resolving the issue with their help , you will have “ gained your brother . ” A matter should be referred to the elders only when repeated efforts to help the wrongdoer have failed . Cases requiring that brothers go through all three steps outlined at Matthew 18 :15-17 are rare . That is encouraging , for it means that a solution is usually found before the situation reaches the point where an unrepentant sinner must be removed from the congregation . Often , the wrongdoer sees his error and corrects matters . The offended person may see that he no longer has a real reason to find fault and may prefer to forgive . Whatever the case , Jesus ’ words indicate that the congregation should not get involved in disagreements prematurely . The elders may intervene only if the preceding two steps have been taken and if solid evidence can be produced to show clearly what has happened . w16 .05 1 :15 , 16

43 The next day he wanted to leave for Galʹi·lee . Jesus then found Philip and said to him : “ Be my follower . ” 44 Now Philip was from Beth·saʹi·da , from the city of Andrew and Peter . 45 Philip found Na·thanʹa·el and said to him : “ We have found the one of whom Moses , in the Law , and the Prophets wrote : Jesus , the son of Joseph , from Nazʹa·reth . ” 46 But Na·thanʹa·el said to him : “ Can anything good come out of Nazʹa·reth ? ” Philip said to him : “ Come and see . ” 47 Jesus saw Na·thanʹa·el coming toward him and said about him : “ See , truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit . ” 48 Na·thanʹa·el said to him : “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered him : “ Before Philip called you , while you were under the fig tree , I saw you . ” 49 Na·thanʹa·el responded : “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God , you are King of Israel . ” 50 Jesus answered him : “ Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see things greater than these . ” 51 He then said to him : “ Most truly I say to you men , you will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man . ”

Still others deal with strength-sapping domestic problems , perhaps being the target of criticism by an unbelieving mate . As a result of these and other pressures , many in the congregation feel physically and emotionally drained . Who can help discouraged ones to keep going ?

36 When Baʹlak heard that Baʹlaam had come , he immediately went out to meet him at the city of Moʹab , which is on the bank of the Arʹnon on the border of the territory . 37 Baʹlak said to Baʹlaam : “ Did I not send for you ? Why did you not come to me ? Did you think I am not able to honor you greatly ? ” 38 Baʹlaam replied to Baʹlak : “ Well , I have come to you now . But will I be allowed to say anything ? I can only speak words that God puts in my mouth . ”
“ This Is the Way ”
JESUS said : “ True worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth , for indeed , the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him . ” ( John 4 :23 ; 6 :44 ) Each of us must “ keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord . ” ( Ephesians 5 :10 ) This is not always easy . Satan tries to mislead us so that we will do things that displease Jehovah .—Revelation 12 :9 .
“ The Christ is head of the congregation . ” —Ephesians 5 :23
While You Are Young , Choose to Serve Jehovah
SAMUEL looked into the faces of his people . The nation had gathered at the town of Gilgal , summoned by this faithful man who had served as prophet and judge for decades . It was May or June by modern reckoning ; the dry season was well along . The fields in the region were golden with wheat ready for harvest . Silence fell over the crowd . How could Samuel reach their hearts ?
May those seeking you not be humiliated because of me ,
He will frustrate the one snapping at me . ( Selah )
For it is in his heart to annihilate ,

15 By the end of the thousand years of Kingdom rule , obedient mankind will have been liberated from all enemies introduced by Adam ’ s disobedience . The Bible says : “ Just as in Adam all are dying , so also in the Christ all will be made alive . But each one in his own proper order : Christ the firstfruits , afterward those who belong to the Christ [ his joint rulers ] during his presence . Next , the end , when he hands over the Kingdom to his God and Father , when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power . For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet . And the last enemy , death , is to be brought to nothing . ” ( 1 Cor . 15 :22-26 ) Yes , death inherited from Adam will at last be done away with . “ The shroud ” that entraps the entire human family will have been removed forever .—Isa . 25 :7 , 8 .
16 But what if another person ’ s conscience lets him do something that seems wrong to us ? We need to be very careful not to be critical and insist that we are right and he is wrong . ( Read Romans 14 :10 . ) Jehovah gave us our conscience to judge ourselves , not to judge others . ( Matthew 7 :1 ) We never want our personal choices to cause division in the congregation . Instead , we look for ways to promote love and unity .—Romans 14 :19 .

It is difficult to imagine the wonders that Jehovah has in store for anointed Christians when they are seated on thrones to rule with Christ in heaven . ( Luke 22 :28-30 ; Phil . 3 :20 , 21 ; 1 John 3 :2 ) They will make up “ the New Jerusalem , ” the bride of Christ . ( Rev . 3 :12 ; 17 :14 ; 21 :2 , 9 , 10 ) They will share with Jesus in “ the healing of the nations , ” directing obedient humans to the means to become free from the burden of sin and death and raising them to perfection . ( Rev . 22 :1 , 2 , 17 ) One of the greatest earthly demonstrations of Jehovah ’ s marvelous kindness will be the resurrection of humans from “ the Grave . ” ( Job 14 :13-15 ; John 5 :28 , 29 ) Faithful men and women of old who died before Christ ’ s sacrificial death , as well as all those “ other sheep ” who die faithful during the last days , will be brought back to life to continue serving Jehovah .—John 10 :16 . w16 .07 4 :13-15

3 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Ju·deʹa , 2 saying : “ Repent , for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near . ” 3 This , in fact , is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words : “ A voice of one calling out in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare the way of Jehovah ! Make his roads straight . ’ ” 4 Now John was clothed with camel ’ s hair and had a leather belt around his waist . His food was locusts and wild honey . 5 Then the people of Jerusalem and all Ju·deʹa and all the country around the Jordan were going out to him , 6 and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River , openly confessing their sins .

21 Jehovah provides something else to protect us : timely spiritual food . To help us draw strength from his Word , Jehovah has commissioned “ the faithful and discreet slave ” to dispense spiritual food . That faithful slave uses printed publications , including the journals The Watchtower and Awake ! , as well as meetings , assemblies , and conventions to provide us with “ food at the proper time ” —what we need , when we need it . ( Matthew 24 :45 ) Have you ever heard something at a Christian meeting—in a comment , in a talk , or even in a prayer—that provided just the needed strength and encouragement ? Has your life ever been touched by a specific article published in one of our journals ? Remember , Jehovah makes all such provisions in order to protect us spiritually .

22 We need to be ready to defend our faith at all times . ( John 15 :19 ) On certain issues , Jehovah ’ s Witnesses take a very different stand from that of most people . Ask yourself : ‘ Do I really understand why we take this stand ? Am I convinced that what the Bible and the faithful and discreet slave say is right ? Am I proud to be one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses ? ( Psalm 34 :2 ; Matthew 10 :32 , 33 ) Can I explain my beliefs to others ? ’ —Matthew 24 :45 ; John 17 :17 ; read 1 Peter 3 :15 .
19 In ancient times , soldiers wore armor to protect themselves on the battlefield . In a similar way , we must wear the “ suit of armor ” that Jehovah has given us . ( Ephesians 6 :13 ) It will protect us . We read about this armor at Ephesians 6 :14-18 : “ Stand firm , therefore , with the belt of truth fastened around your waist , wearing the breastplate of righteousness , and having your feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace . Besides all of this , take up the large shield of faith , with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked one ’ s burning arrows . Also , accept the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the spirit , that is , God ’ s word , while with every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit . ”

Jehovah created humans with remarkable abilities . He gave us thinking ability to solve problems and plan for the future . ( Prov . 2 :11 ) He gave us power to carry out our plans , enabling us to work toward proper goals . ( Phil . 2 :13 ) He also created us with a conscience—an inborn sense of right and wrong—that can help us avoid wrongdoing and correct our mistakes when we fall short . ( Rom . 2 :15 ) Through his Word , Jehovah repeatedly admonishes us to use our abilities for good . For example , in the Hebrew Scriptures , we read : “ The plans of the diligent surely lead to success ” ; and “ whatever your hand finds to do , do with all your might . ” ( Prov . 21 :5 ; Eccl . 9 :10 ) In the Christian Greek Scriptures , we are told : “ As long as we have the opportunity , let us work what is good toward all ” ; and “ to the extent that each one has received a gift , use it in ministering to one another . ” ( Gal . 6 :10 ; 1 Pet . 4 :10 ) Clearly , Jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others . w17 .01 1 :1 , 2

6 Ever since then , Christ ’ s ransom has benefited his followers the world over . Whether we are among the anointed “ little flock , ” who will rule with Christ in heaven , or are among the “ other sheep , ” who will live under his rule on earth , we benefit from his sacrifice . ( Luke 12 :32 ; John 10 :16 ) It is the basis for our hope and for forgiveness of our sins . As long as we continue “ exercising faith ” in that ransom , following Jesus day by day , we can enjoy a clean conscience and a bright hope for the future .—John 3 :16 .

16 Who , though , was ultimately responsible for providing David and his men with sustenance ? David was convinced that Jehovah cares for his people . Jehovah can surely give other servants of his a nudge , so to speak , moving them to come to the aid of a fellow worshipper in need . When reflecting on what happened in the land of Gilead , David no doubt saw the kindness of those three men as an expression of Jehovah ’ s loving care . Toward the end of his life , David wrote : “ A young man I used to be , I have also grown old , and yet I have not seen anyone righteous [ including him ] left entirely , nor his offspring looking for bread . ” ( Ps . 37 :25 ) Is it not comforting to know that Jehovah ’ s hand is never short ? —Prov . 10 :3 .

Now there was a royal official whose son was sick in Ca·perʹna·um . 47 When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee , he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of dying . 48 But Jesus said to him : “ Unless you people see signs and wonders , you will never believe . ” 49 The royal official said to him : “ Lord , come down before my young child dies . ” 50 Jesus said to him : “ Go your way ; your son lives . ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he left . 51 But while he was on his way down , his slaves met him to say that his boy was alive . 52 So he asked them at what hour he got better . They replied to him : “ The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour . ” 53 The father then knew that it was in the very hour that Jesus had said to him : “ Your son lives . ” So he and his whole household believed . 54 This was the second sign Jesus performed when he came from Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee .

19 How can we help others to follow Jesus ’ example ? Suppose we want to encourage a Bible student who qualifies to begin sharing in the public preaching work . Or perhaps we want to help an inactive one to have a full share in the ministry again . How can we assist such ones ? We need to appeal to their heart . Recall that first Jesus was “ moved with pity ” for people , and then he taught them . ( Mark 6 :34 ) So if we can help them to cultivate compassion , their hearts may well move them to be like Jesus and share the good news with others . We might ask them : “ How has accepting the Kingdom message changed your life for the better ? What about people who do not yet know this message—do they not also need the good news ? What can you do to help them ? ” Of course , the strongest motivation for sharing in the ministry is love for God and a desire to serve him .

She would not go to the king again unless the king had been especially pleased with her and she was requested by name .

EVEN though Jehovah was completely alone before he began to create , he was not thinking only of himself . On the contrary , he gave the gift of life to intelligent creatures , both spirit and human . “ The happy God , ” Jehovah , loves to give good things .

6 Some brothers saw the issue clearly and met it head-on . Herbert Senior , quoted earlier , said : “ To me , there was no difference in principle between unloading shells from a ship [ noncombatant service ] and putting those shells into a gun to be fired . ” ( Luke 16 :10 ) As a result of his conscientious objection to military service , Brother Senior was sent to prison . He and 4 other brothers were among a group of 16 conscientious objectors , including men from other religious denominations , who served some of their time at Richmond prison in Britain and later became known as the Richmond 16 . At one point , Herbert and others like him were secretly shipped to the front lines in France . There , they were sentenced to be shot . He and a number of others were lined up in front of a firing squad , but they were not killed . Instead , their sentence was commuted to ten years in prison .

8 Regrettably , Adam was not content with his God-given assignment as cultivator and caretaker of the earthly paradise . He was not satisfied with his extensive freedom to carry out his God-given mandate : “ Be fruitful and become many , fill the earth and subdue it , and have in subjection the fish . . . , the flying creatures . . . , and every living creature that is moving on the earth . ” ( Gen . 1 :28 ) Instead , he chose to overstep his God-ordained boundaries by eating the forbidden fruit . This gross misuse of free will resulted in millenniums of suffering and pain for Adam ’ s descendants . ( Rom . 5 :12 ) Knowing the consequences of Adam ’ s decision should move us to use our freedom responsibly and within the limits set by Jehovah .

12 Jehovah has provided overseers to take the lead in the Christian congregation . ( Hebrews 13 :17 ) These qualified men are to use their God-given authority to provide needed assistance and to contribute to the welfare of the flock . Does their position entitle elders to lord it over their fellow believers ? Not at all ! Elders need to have a balanced , humble view of their role in the congregation . ( 1 Peter 5 :2 , 3 ) The Bible tells overseers : “ Shepherd the congregation of God , which he purchased with the blood of his own Son . ” ( Acts 20 :28 ) Therein lies a powerful reason for treating each member of the flock with tenderness .

In short , he tells her : ‘ Stay in my fields ; there is no need for you to go to others . Keep close to my young women ; you will be safe with them .

God does not determine his course of action based on a momentary flare-up of anger , the type of emotional outburst that many humans display . Yet , after observing the Ninevites ’ repentant , changed attitude , Jehovah adjusted his decision . In doing so , he manifested reasonableness , humility , and compassion . Similarly , there may be occasions when it would be good for us to reconsider a choice or decision . It could be when the prevailing circumstances change . Jehovah altered his decision at times when circumstances changed . ( 1 Ki . 21 :20 , 21 , 27-29 ; 2 Ki . 20 :1-5 ) Or new information may provide us with a valid reason to adjust a decision . King David was given faulty information about Saul ’ s grandson Mephibosheth .

Have you been assigned to read a portion of the Bible or possibly the paragraphs of an article in The Watchtower ?

Then try to incorporate these qualities into your own reading .
5 And it was granted the locusts , not to kill them , but to torment them five months , and their torment was like torment by a scorpion when it strikes a person . 6 In those days people will seek death but will by no means find it , and they will long to die , but death will flee from them .
2 That verse is repeatedly used in the book What Does the Bible Really Teach ? As you study this book with your children or others , you will likely read Romans 5 :12 when you discuss God ’ s purpose for the earth , the ransom , and the condition of the dead—chapters 3 , 5 , and 6 . But how often do you think of Romans 5 :12 with regard to your own standing before Jehovah , your actions , and your future prospects ?

15 She now said to him : “ How can you say , ‘ I love you , ’ when your heart is not with me ? These three times you have fooled me and have not told me the source of your great power . ” 16 Because day after day she kept nagging him and pressuring him , he was weary to the point of dying . 17 So he finally opened his heart to her , saying : “ A razor has never touched my head , because I am a Nazʹi·rite of God from birth . If I am shaved , my power will leave me and I will grow weak and become like all other men . ”

The importance of the proper motive in reading becomes clear upon examination of the Gospel accounts . In Matthew ’ s Gospel , for example , we find Jesus asking well-versed religious leaders such questions as “ Have you not read ? ” and “ Did you never read this ? ” prior to his giving them the Scriptural answers to their crafty questions . ( Matt . 12 :3 , 5 ; 19 :4 ; 21 :16 , 42 ; 22 :31 ) One lesson we learn from this is that if our motive for reading is improper , we can draw incorrect conclusions or miss the point altogether . The Pharisees were reading the Scriptures because they thought that by means of them , they would get everlasting life . That reward , as Jesus pointed out , is not granted to those who do not love God and accept His means of salvation . ( John 5 :39-43 ) The intentions of the Pharisees were selfish ; hence , many of their conclusions were wrong .

At times , the pressures of life can make finding the time to preach challenging . Yet , by ‘ exerting yourself vigorously ’ as a preacher , you demonstrate the importance you attach to the “ good news . ” ( Luke 13 :24 ; Romans 1 :16 ) You may thus be viewed as “ an example to the faithful ones . ” —1 Timothy 4 :12 .

13 Alain , who has been learning the Persian language for about eight years , admits : “ When I prepare for meetings in Persian , I tend to focus on the language itself .

That is why I regularly set aside time to study the Bible and other publications in my mother tongue . ”

One capital was five cubits high , and the other capital was five cubits high . 17 The capital on top of each pillar had mesh network with wreathed chains ; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital . 18 And he made pomegranates in two rows around the one network to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars ; he did the same for both capitals . 19 The capitals on top of the pillars at the porch were of a lily pattern four cubits high . 20 The capitals were on the two pillars , just above the rounded portion adjoining the network ; and there were 200 pomegranates in rows all around on each capital .
18 Some skeptics might ask : ‘ How could such a thing happen ? And how could all those animals coexist peacefully in a confined space ? ’ Consider : Is it really beyond the power of the Creator of the entire universe to control his animal creations , even render them tame and docile if needed ? Remember , Jehovah is the God who created the animals . Much later , he also parted the Red Sea and made the sun stand still . Could he not carry out every event described in Noah ’ s account ? Of course he could , and he did !

When you squat outside , you should dig a hole with it and then cover your excrement . 14 For Jehovah your God is walking about within your camp to deliver you and to hand over your enemies to you , and your camp must be holy , so that he does not see anything indecent in you and turn away from accompanying you .

44 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses , saying : 45 “ Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites , and take the domestic animals of the Levites in place of their domestic animals , and the Levites must become mine . I am Jehovah . 46 As the ransom price of the 273 of the firstborn of the Israelites who are in excess of the Levites , 47 you are to take five shekels for each individual , according to the standard shekel of the holy place . A shekel is 20 geʹrahs . 48 You are to give the money to Aaron and his sons as the ransom price of those who are in excess of them . ” 49 So Moses took the money of the redemption price from those who were in excess of the ransom price of the Levites . 50 He took the money from the firstborn of the Israelites , 1 ,365 shekels , according to the standard shekel of the holy place . 51 Then Moses gave the money of the ransom price to Aaron and his sons according to the word of Jehovah , just as Jehovah had commanded Moses .

And in Section 4 , you saw that he has directly expressed his love for mankind—and for you personally—in remarkable ways . Now comes a question . In a way , it is the most important question you can ask yourself : ‘ How will I respond to Jehovah ’ s love ? ’

13 Now there was no food in all the land , because the famine was very severe , and the land of Egypt and the land of Caʹnaan became exhausted as a result of the famine . 14 Joseph was collecting all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Caʹnaan for the grain that people were buying , and Joseph kept bringing the money into Pharʹaoh ’ s house . 15 In time the money from the land of Egypt and the land of Caʹnaan was spent , and all the Egyptians began coming to Joseph , saying : “ Give us food ! Why should we die before your very eyes because our money has run out ? ” 16 Then Joseph said : “ If your money has run out , hand over your livestock , and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock . ” 17 So they began bringing their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph kept giving them food in exchange for their horses , the livestock of the flock and of the herd , and the donkeys , and he kept providing them with food in exchange for all their livestock during that year .

It is near and it is approaching very quickly ! ” ( Zephaniah 1 :14 ) Yes , the time is coming quickly when Jehovah will bring this whole system of things to its end . People need to be warned !

15 And Jehovah said to me : “ Now take the equipment of a useless shepherd . 16 For I am letting a shepherd rise up in the land . He will not take care of the sheep that are perishing ; he will not seek out the young or heal the injured or feed those able to stand . Instead , he devours the flesh of the fat one and tears off the hooves of the sheep .
Jesus said these things and went off and hid from them . 37 Although he had performed so many signs before them , they were not putting faith in him , 38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , who said : “ Jehovah , who has put faith in the thing heard from us ? And as for the arm of Jehovah , to whom has it been revealed ? ” 39 The reason why they were not able to believe is that again Isaiah said : 40 “ He has blinded their eyes and has made their hearts hard , so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn around and I heal them . ” 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory , and he spoke about him . 42 All the same , many even of the rulers actually put faith in him , but they would not acknowledge him because of the Pharisees , so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue ; 43 for they loved the glory of men even more than the glory of God .

27 And Hez·e·kiʹah came to have vast riches and glory ; and he made storehouses for himself for silver , gold , precious stones , balsam oil , shields , and for all the desirable articles . 28 He also made storage places for the produce of grain and new wine and oil , as well as stalls for all the different kinds of livestock and stalls for the flocks . 29 He also acquired cities for himself , and an abundance of livestock , flocks , and herds , for God gave him very many possessions . 30 It was Hez·e·kiʹah who stopped up the upper source of the waters of Giʹhon and directed them straight down to the west to the City of David , and Hez·e·kiʹah was successful in every work of his . 31 However , when the spokesmen of the princes of Babylon were sent to ask him about the sign that had occurred in the land , the true God left him alone to put him to the test , to get to know all that was in his heart .

It is something most holy .

13 A Christian wife also has an important and dignified role . She supports her husband as he works hard to be a good family head . Together with him , she has the responsibility to train the children . One way she teaches her children to be respectful is by her own example . ( Proverbs 1 :8 ) She respects her husband and cooperates with his decisions . Even when she does not agree with him about something , she explains her feelings in a kind and respectful way . When a Christian woman is married to a non-Witness , she has unique challenges . But if she continues to treat her husband with love and respect , perhaps one day he too will want to know Jehovah and worship him .—Read 1 Peter 3 :1 .
26 There were two of the men still in the camp . Their names were Elʹdad and Meʹdad . And the spirit began to settle down on them , as they were among those whose names had been written down , but they had not gone out to the tent . So they began to behave as prophets in the camp . 27 And a young man ran and reported to Moses : “ Elʹdad and Meʹdad are behaving as prophets in the camp ! ” 28 Then Joshua the son of Nun , the minister of Moses from his youth , responded and said : “ My lord Moses , restrain them ! ” 29 But Moses said to him : “ Are you jealous for me ? No , I wish that all of Jehovah ’ s people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his spirit on them ! ” 30 Later Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel .
17 And the Chal·deʹans broke into pieces the copper pillars of the house of Jehovah and the carriages and the copper Sea that were in the house of Jehovah , and they carried all the copper away to Babylon . 18 They also took the cans , the shovels , the extinguishers , the bowls , the cups , and all the copper utensils used in the temple service . 19 The chief of the guard took the basins , the fire holders , the bowls , the cans , the lampstands , the cups , and the bowls that were of genuine gold and silver . 20 As for the two pillars , the Sea , the 12 copper bulls under the Sea , and the carriages that King Solʹo·mon had made for the house of Jehovah , the copper of all these articles was beyond weighing .

They abandoned Jehovah and did not serve him . 7 Then Jehovah ’ s anger blazed against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Phi·lisʹtines and the Amʹmon·ites . 8 So they crushed and greatly oppressed the Israelites in that year—for 18 years they oppressed all the Israelites on the side of the Jordan that had been the land of the Amʹor·ites in Gilʹe·ad . 9 The Amʹmon·ites would also cross the Jordan to fight against Judah and Benjamin and the house of Eʹphra·im ; and Israel was greatly distressed . 10 Then the Israelites called to Jehovah for help , saying : “ We have sinned against you , for we abandoned our God and served the Baʹals . ”

8 After that Cain said to his brother Abel : “ Let us go over into the field . ” So while they were in the field , Cain assaulted his brother Abel and killed him . 9 Later on , Jehovah said to Cain : “ Where is your brother Abel ? ” and he said : “ I do not know . Am I my brother ’ s guardian ? ” 10 At this He said : “ What have you done ? Listen ! Your brother ’ s blood is crying out to me from the ground . 11 And now you are cursed in banishment from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother ’ s blood from your hand . 12 When you cultivate the ground , it will not give you back its produce . You will become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth . ” 13 At this Cain said to Jehovah : “ The punishment for my error is too great to bear . 14 Today you are driving me from the land , and I will be hidden from your face ; and I will become a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth , and anyone who finds me will certainly kill me . ” 15 So Jehovah said to him : “ For that reason , anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times . ”

59 This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet gave as a command to Se·raiʹah son of Ne·riʹah son of Mah·seiʹah when he went with King Zed·e·kiʹah of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign ; Se·raiʹah was the quartermaster . 60 Jeremiah wrote in one book all the calamity that would come upon Babylon , all these words written against Babylon . 61 Furthermore , Jeremiah said to Se·raiʹah : “ When you come to Babylon and see her , you must read aloud all these words . 62 Then say , ‘ O Jehovah , you have said against this place that it will be destroyed and left without an inhabitant , man or beast , and that she will become desolate forever . ’ 63 And when you finish reading this book , tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Eu·phraʹtes . 64 Then say , ‘ This is how Babylon will sink down and never rise again because of the calamity that I am bringing on her ; and they will grow weary . ’ ”
Nor is it only old men who understand what is right .
The environment in which Jehovah is now molding us is viewed as a spiritual paradise that is presently taking shape . ( Isa . 64 :8 ) We feel safe and secure despite the wicked world around us . We have come to know Jehovah and now experience his fatherly love . ( Jas . 4 :8 ) In the new world , we will experience to the full the blessings of the spiritual paradise . Then , our spiritual paradise will have its perfect counterpart—a literal paradise under the rulership of God ’ s Kingdom . During that time of global restoration , Jehovah will continue to mold earth ’ s inhabitants , educating them to a degree that we might now find hard to imagine . ( Isa . 11 :9 ) Furthermore , God will make our minds and bodies perfect , so that we will be able to absorb his teaching and do his will flawlessly . So let us be determined to continue submitting to Jehovah , showing him that we view his molding as an expression of his love for us . w16 .06 1 :8 , 9
16 Joshua conquered all this land , the mountainous region , all the Negʹeb , all the land of Goʹshen , the She·pheʹlah , the Arʹa·bah , and the mountainous region of Israel and its She·pheʹlah , 17 from Mount Haʹlak , which goes up to Seʹir , and as far as Baʹal-gad in the Valley of Lebʹa·non at the base of Mount Herʹmon , and he captured all their kings and defeated them , putting them to death . 18 Joshua waged war with all these kings for quite some time . 19 There was no city that made peace with the Israelites except the Hiʹvites inhabiting Gibʹe·on . They conquered all the others by war . 20 It was Jehovah who allowed their hearts to become stubborn so that they waged war against Israel , in order for him to devote them to destruction without any favorable consideration . They were to be annihilated , just as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
7 At last , the time of restoration came . Freed from Babylon , the Jews returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt Jehovah ’ s temple there . ( Ezra 1 :1 , 2 ) As long as they adhered to pure worship , Jehovah blessed them and made their land fertile and prosperous . He protected them from enemies and from the wild beasts that had overrun their land for decades . How they must have rejoiced in Jehovah ’ s restorative power ! But those events represented only an initial , limited fulfillment of many restoration prophecies . A greater fulfillment was to come “ in the final part of the days , ” our own time , when the long-promised Heir of King David would be enthroned .—Isaiah 2 :2-4 ; 9 :6 , 7 .
25 Regarding the settlements with their fields , some of the people of Judah lived in Kirʹi·ath-arʹba and its dependent towns , in Diʹbon and its dependent towns , in Je·kabʹze·el and its settlements , 26 in Jeshʹu·a , in Mo·laʹdah , in Beth-pelʹet , 27 in Haʹzar-shuʹal , in Beʹer-sheʹba and its dependent towns , 28 in Zikʹlag , in Me·coʹnah and its dependent towns , 29 in En-rimʹmon , in Zoʹrah , and in Jarʹmuth , 30 in Za·noʹah , in A·dulʹlam and their settlements , in Laʹchish and its fields , and in A·zeʹkah and its dependent towns .

17 After consulting with his advisers , King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah sent a message to Je·hoʹash son of Je·hoʹa·haz son of Jeʹhu the king of Israel , saying : “ Come ! Let us confront each other in battle . ” 18 King Je·hoʹash of Israel sent this message to King Am·a·ziʹah of Judah : “ The thorny weed in Lebʹa·non sent a message to the cedar in Lebʹa·non , ‘ Give your daughter to my son as a wife . ’ However , a wild beast of Lebʹa·non passed by and trampled down the thorny weed . 19 You have said , ‘ Look ! I have struck down Eʹdom . ’ So your heart has become arrogant , wanting to be glorified . But now stay in your own house . Why should you provoke disaster and fall , bringing Judah down with you ? ”
A popular philosophy or common adage is : Follow your heart . But doing that can be dangerous . And in a sense , doing so is unscriptural . The Bible warns us not to let our imperfect heart or mere sentiment rule when we are making decisions . And Bible accounts show the sad consequences of following one ’ s heart . The core problem is that in imperfect humans , “ the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate . ” ( Jer . 3 :17 ; 13 :10 ; 17 :9 ; 1 Ki . 11 :9 ) So , what could it mean for us if we simply follow our heart and let our emotions dictate our thinking and actions ? For example , what might happen if we make decisions when we are angry ? The answer may be obvious if we have done this in times past . ( Prov . 14 :17 ; 29 :22 ) Or is it likely that we will make sound decisions when we are discouraged ? ( Num . 32 :6-12 ; Prov . 24 :10 ) Clearly , we could easily be deceived by our emotions if we allow them to prevail when we are making important decisions . w17 .03 2 :12 , 13

12 Jesus powerfully taught that the Pharisees were wrong about the Sabbath law—that , in fact , they had missed the whole point of that law . The Messiah , he explained , is “ Lord of the sabbath ” and therefore entitled to cure people on the Sabbath . ( Matthew 12 :8 ) To stress the point , he openly performed miraculous cures on the Sabbath . ( Luke 6 :7-10 ) Such cures were a preview of the healing that he will perform earth wide during his Thousand Year Reign . That Millennium will itself be the ultimate Sabbath , when all faithful mankind will at last rest from centuries of laboring under the burdens of sin and death .

14 Read aloud . ( Rev . 1 :3 ) Some students try to study a new language silently by themselves . This does not produce the best results . When studying the pure language , we may at times need to read “ in an undertone ” to help our concentration . ( Read Psalm 1 :1 , 2 . ) Doing this impresses indelibly on our minds the material we are reading . In Hebrew , the expression “ to read in an undertone ” is closely related to meditation . Just as digestion is needed if we are to benefit fully from the food we eat , meditation is needed if we are to absorb what we read . Do we allow enough time to meditate on what we study ? After reading the Bible , we must think deeply about what we have read .

19 “ I will set a sign among them , and I will send some of those who escape to the nations—to Tarʹshish , Pul , and Lud , those who draw the bow , to Tuʹbal and Jaʹvan , and to the faraway islands—who have not heard a report about me or seen my glory ; and they will proclaim my glory among the nations . 20 They will bring all your brothers out of all the nations as a gift to Jehovah , on horses , in chariots , in covered wagons , on mules , and on swift camels , up to my holy mountain , Jerusalem , ” says Jehovah , “ just as when the people of Israel bring their gift in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah . ”
25 For I do not want you to be unaware of this sacred secret , brothers , so that you do not become wise in your own eyes : A partial dulling of senses has come upon Israel until the full number of people of the nations has come in , 26 and in this manner all Israel will be saved . Just as it is written : “ The deliverer will come out of Zion and turn away ungodly practices from Jacob . 27 And this is my covenant with them , when I take their sins away . ” 28 True , with respect to the good news , they are enemies for your sakes ; but with respect to God ’ s choosing , they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers . 29 For the gifts and the calling of God are not things he will regret . 30 For just as you were once disobedient to God but have now been shown mercy because of their disobedience , 31 so also these now have been disobedient with mercy resulting to you , so that they themselves may also now be shown mercy . 32 For God has confined all of them together in disobedience so that he might show all of them mercy .

6 But the Israelites again did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah , so Jehovah gave them into the hand of Midʹi·an for seven years . 2 The hand of Midʹi·an dominated over Israel . Because of Midʹi·an , the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains , in the caves , and in the places difficult to approach . 3 If Israel sowed seed , Midʹi·an and Amʹa·lek and the Easterners would attack them . 4 They would camp against them and ruin the produce of the land all the way to Gazʹa , and they left nothing for Israel to eat and no sheep or bull or donkey . 5 For they would come up with their livestock and tents as numerous as the locusts , and they and their camels could not be numbered , and they would come into the land to destroy it . 6 So Israel became greatly impoverished on account of Midʹi·an ; and the Israelites called to Jehovah for help .

5 So Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria , so that they defeated him and carried off a great number of captives and brought them to Damascus . He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel , who inflicted on him a great slaughter . 6 For Peʹkah the son of Rem·a·liʹah killed in Judah 120 ,000 in one day , all brave men , because they had abandoned Jehovah the God of their forefathers . 7 And Zichʹri , an Eʹphra·im·ite warrior , killed the king ’ s son Ma·a·seiʹah and Az·riʹkam , who was in charge of the palace , and El·kaʹnah , who was second to the king . 8 Moreover , the Israelites took 200 ,000 of their brothers captive—women , sons , and daughters ; they also seized a great deal of spoil , and they took the spoil to Sa·marʹi·a .
4 The disciple James explained : “ If any man thinks he is a worshipper of God but does not keep a tight rein on his tongue , he is deceiving his own heart , and his worship is futile . ” ( James 1 :26 ) We would be deceiving ourselves if we thought that as long as we did some good things , God would not care if we were rude or sarcastic or if we told lies . What can help us to avoid deceiving ourselves ?
4 From the start of human existence , men and women have had to make important decisions . Adam had to choose to listen either to his Creator or to Eve . He was willing to make a decision , but what do you think of the decision he made ?

We are still suffering the consequences of Adam ’ s terrible decision .

17 After these things , the son of the woman who owned the house fell sick , and his sickness became so severe that he stopped breathing . 18 At this she said to E·liʹjah : “ What do you have against me , O man of the true God ? Have you come to remind me of my guilt and to put my son to death ? ” 19 But he said to her : “ Give me your son . ” Then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the roof chamber , where he was staying , and he laid him on his own bed . 20 He called out to Jehovah : “ O Jehovah my God , are you also bringing harm to the widow with whom I am staying by putting her son to death ? ” 21 Then he stretched himself out over the child three times and called out to Jehovah : “ O Jehovah my God , please , let this child ’ s life come back into him . ” 22 Jehovah listened to E·liʹjah ’ s request , and the life of the child came back into him , and he revived . 23 E·liʹjah took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother ; and E·liʹjah said : “ See , your son is alive . ” 24 At that the woman said to E·liʹjah : “ Now I know that you truly are a man of God and that Jehovah ’ s word in your mouth is truth . ”

28 Finally they got close to the village to which they were traveling , and he made as if to travel on farther . 29 But they urged him to remain , saying : “ Stay with us , because it is almost evening and the day is nearly over . ” With that he went in to stay with them . 30 And as he was dining with them , he took the bread , blessed it , broke it , and began handing it to them . 31 At that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him ; but he disappeared from them . 32 And they said to each other : “ Were not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road , as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us ? ” 33 And they got up in that very hour and returned to Jerusalem , and they found the Eleven and those assembled together with them , 34 who said : “ For a fact the Lord was raised up , and he appeared to Simon ! ” 35 Then they related the events on the road and how he became known to them by the breaking of the bread .
16 At times , we may feel that we are accomplishing little , or we might wonder whether Jehovah is pleased with our efforts . We may even doubt that we qualify to receive any kind of reward . Let us never forget , though , that “ God is greater than our hearts and knows all things . ” ( Read 1 John 3 :19 , 20 . ) He rewards every expression of sacred service that springs from a heart motivated by faith and love , no matter how insignificant it might seem to the giver of the sacrifice .—Mark 12 :41-44 .

20 Along with Jesus , these anointed ones become “ Abraham ’ s seed . ” ( Galatians 3 :29 ) The first ones chosen were fleshly Jews . But in 36 C .E . , another aspect of the sacred secret was revealed : Gentiles , or non-Jews , would also share in the heavenly hope . ( Romans 9 :6-8 ; 11 :25 , 26 ; Ephesians 3 :5 , 6 ) Would anointed Christians be the only ones to enjoy the blessings promised to Abraham ? No , for Jesus ’ sacrifice benefits the whole world . ( 1 John 2 :2 ) In time , Jehovah revealed that an unnumbered “ great crowd ” would survive the end of Satan ’ s system of things . ( Revelation 7 :9 , 14 ) Multitudes more would be resurrected with the prospect of living forever in Paradise ! —Luke 23 :43 ; John 5 :28 , 29 ; Revelation 20 :11-15 ; 21 :3 , 4 .
In the north , the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic (RSI) , a Nazi puppet state with Mussolini installed as leader . The post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement , the Resistenza . In late April 1945 , with total defeat looming , Mussolini attempted to escape north ,[80] but was captured and summarly executed near Lake Como by Italian partisans . His body was then taken to Milan , where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise .[81] Hostilities ended on 29 April 1945 , when the German forces in Italy surrendered . Nearly half a million Italians (including civilians) died in the conflict ,[82] and the Italian economy had been all but destroyed ; per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century .[83]

15 Would doing this particular work in itself constitute an act condemned in the Bible ? God ’ s Word clearly condemns stealing , lying , and the making of idols . ( Exodus 20 :4 ; Acts 15 :29 ; Ephesians 4 :28 ; Revelation 21 :8 ) We would reject any employment that required us to do such things . Our love for Jehovah would never allow us to accept a job that involves engaging in practices that violate God ’ s commands .—Read 1 John 5 :3 .

The success of your talk depends , not on the number of scriptures used , but on the quality of the teaching . When introducing scriptures , show why they are being used . Allow time to apply them . After you read a scripture , keep your Bible open as you discuss the text . Your audience will likely do the same . How can you stir the interest of your audience and help them to benefit more fully from God ’ s Word ? ( Neh . 8 :8 , 12 ) You can do so by explanation , illustration , and application .
17 Do not expect perfection from your brothers . Keep a balanced view of your spiritual brothers and sisters . To expect faultless behavior from your brothers is unrealistic and will bring disappointment . ( Eccl . 7 :21 , 22 ) Remember , Jehovah is realistic in what he requires of his servants . If we imitate his example , we will be prepared to put up with the imperfections of others . ( Eph . 4 :2 , 32 ) Instead of giving them the impression that they are not doing enough , make it a point to commend them for what they are doing . That can encourage them . Sincere commendation can build others up in love and help them to find “ cause for rejoicing ” in their own sacred service . How much better when we do so rather than express frustrating comparisons with others .—Gal . 6 :4 .
12 For all those who sinned without law will also perish without law ; but all those who sinned under law will be judged by law . 13 For the hearers of law are not the ones righteous before God , but the doers of law will be declared righteous . 14 For when people of the nations , who do not have law , do by nature the things of the law , these people , although not having law , are a law to themselves . 15 They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts , while their conscience is bearing witness with them , and by their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused . 16 This will take place in the day when God through Christ Jesus judges the secret things of mankind , according to the good news I declare .

14 Attaining perfection , however , involves much more than having a sound body and a sound mind . It includes properly reflecting Jehovah ’ s qualities , since we were made ‘ in God ’ s image , according to his likeness . ’ ( Genesis 1 :26 ) To that end , much education will be required . In the new world , “ righteousness is to dwell . ” So , as Isaiah foretold , “ righteousness is what the inhabitants of the productive land will certainly learn . ” ( 2 Peter 3 :13 ; Isaiah 26 :9 ) This quality leads to peace—between people of all races , among close associates , in one ’ s family and , above all , with God himself . ( Psalm 85 :10-13 ; Isaiah 32 :17 ) Those who learn righteousness will progressively be educated in God ’ s will for them . As love for Jehovah becomes deeply rooted in their hearts , they will follow his ways in every aspect of their lives . They will be able to say as did Jesus , ‘ I always do the things pleasing to my Father . ’ ( John 8 :29 ) How enjoyable life will be when that is true of all humankind !

What would Nathan do ? Would he let someone else bring up the matter to the king ? Others were aware of how David had arranged to have Uriah killed .

18 Can children see ways that they can be more like Jesus and make their parents happy ? True , young ones may sometimes find it hard to obey their parents , but that is what God wants children to do . ( Proverbs 1 :8 ; 6 :20 ) Jesus always obeyed his heavenly Father , even under difficult circumstances . Once , when it was God ’ s will that Jesus do something especially hard , Jesus said : “ Remove this cup [ a certain requirement ] from me . ” Nevertheless , Jesus did what God asked , because he realized that his Father knew best . ( Luke 22 :42 ) By learning to be obedient , children will make their parents and their heavenly Father very happy .—Proverbs 23 :22-25 .

So if you are looking for me , let these men go . ” 9 This was to fulfill what he had said : “ Of those whom you have given me , I have not lost a single one . ”
13 In response one of the elders said to me : “ These who are dressed in the white robes , who are they and where did they come from ? ” 14 So right away I said to him : “ My lord , you are the one who knows . ” And he said to me : “ These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation , and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb . 15 That is why they are before the throne of God , and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple ; and the One seated on the throne will spread his tent over them . 16 They will hunger no more nor thirst anymore , neither will the sun beat down on them nor any scorching heat , 17 because the Lamb , who is in the midst of the throne , will shepherd them and will guide them to springs of waters of life .

Some may feel that it does not matter what we choose to do . To make wise decisions that please Jehovah , however , we must consider the laws and principles found in his written Word and comply with them . For instance , to have God ’ s approval , we must act in harmony with his law on blood . ( Gen . 9 :4 ; Acts 15 :28 , 29 ) Prayer will help us to make decisions that relate to Scriptural principles and laws . Weighty personal decisions can have quite a bearing on our spiritual health and welfare . Every choice we make will likely affect our relationship with Jehovah—either for good or for bad . A good decision will strengthen our relationship with God , whereas a bad one may damage it . Moreover , a poor decision could injure others spiritually by disturbing , or even stumbling , them or by disrupting the unity of the congregation . Indeed , our personal decisions do matter .—Rom . 14 :19 . w16 .05 3 :4 , 5

And you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye , and he will speak to you face-to-face , and you will go to Babylon . ’ 4 However , hear the word of Jehovah , O King Zed·e·kiʹah of Judah , ‘ This is what Jehovah says concerning you : “ You will not die by the sword . 5 In peace you will die , and they will make a burning ceremony for you as they did for your fathers , the former kings who were before you , and they will mourn you , ‘ Alas , O master ! ’ for ‘ I have spoken the word , ’ declares Jehovah . ” ’ ” ’ ”
2 Even so , Moses apparently called out to Jehovah , and God responded : “ Why do you keep crying out to me ? . . . Lift up your rod and stretch your hand out over the sea and split it apart . ” ( Exodus 14 :15 , 16 ) Just picture the unfolding of events . Jehovah immediately commands his angel , and the pillar of cloud moves to Israel ’ s rear , perhaps spreading out like a wall and blocking the Egyptian line of attack . ( Exodus 14 :19 , 20 ; Psalm 105 :39 ) Moses stretches out his hand . Driven by a strong wind , the sea splits apart . The waters somehow congeal and stand up like walls , opening up a path wide enough to accommodate the entire nation ! —Exodus 14 :21 ; 15 :8 .

Become many there , and do not decrease . 7 And seek the peace of the city to which I have exiled you , and pray in its behalf to Jehovah , for in its peace you will have peace . 8 For this is what Jehovah of armies , the God of Israel , says : “ Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you , and do not listen to the dreams that they are dreaming . 9 For ‘ they are prophesying lies to you in my name . I have not sent them , ’ declares Jehovah . ” ’ ”

14 Another way to guard our gift of free will is to put our trust in Jehovah and let him guide us within the protective boundaries that he has set for us . He alone is ‘ the One teaching us to benefit ourselves , the One guiding us in the way we should walk . ’ ( Isa . 48 :17 ) We must humbly acknowledge the truthfulness of the inspired words : “ Man ’ s way does not belong to him . It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step . ” ( Jer . 10 :23 ) May we never fall into the trap of choosing to rely on our own understanding , as did Adam and the rebellious Israelites . Instead , may we “ trust in Jehovah with all [ our ] heart . ” —Prov . 3 :5 .

24 When the ten others heard about it , they became indignant at the two brothers . 25 But Jesus called them to him and said : “ You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them . 26 This must not be the way among you ; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister , 27 and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave . 28 Just as the Son of man came , not to be ministered to , but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many . ”
On the other hand , you may be invited to present material on which no article appears in Our Kingdom Ministry . Reference may be made to a Watchtower article , or the assignment may consist of a few brief notes . It is up to you as a teacher to consider the needs of the congregation in relation to the assigned material . You may need to use a brief , pointed illustration or relate a fitting experience .

18 When that year came to its close , they began coming to him the next year and saying : “ We will not hide from my lord that the money and the stock of domestic animals have already been given to my lord . We have nothing left for my lord but our bodies and our land . 19 Why should we die before your eyes , both we and our land ? Buy us and our land in exchange for food , and we together with our land will become slaves to Pharʹaoh . Give us seed so that we may live and not die and that our land may not become desolate . ” 20 Joseph then bought all the land of the Egyptians for Pharʹaoh because every Egyptian sold his field , for the famine was very severe ; and the land became Pharʹaoh ’ s .
10 What , though , can that mean for us ? You might feel that you could never build such a bond with Jehovah . Granted , none of us has the exalted position of the Son . However , we do have a remarkable opportunity . Remember , Jesus drew closer to his Father by working with Him . Jehovah lovingly offers us the opportunity to be his “ fellow workers . ” ( 1 Corinthians 3 :9 ) As we follow Jesus ’ example in the ministry , we should always keep in mind that we are God ’ s fellow workers . Thus , the bond of love that unites us with Jehovah grows ever stronger . Could there be any greater privilege ?

2 In some respects , this illustrates what Jehovah has done for us . Surely we are indebted to him . After all , he has provided the ransom , making it possible for us to be rescued from the clutches of sin and death . We feel safe knowing that as long as we exercise faith in that precious sacrifice , our sins are forgiven , and our eternal future is secure . ( 1 John 1 :7 ; 4 :9 ) As we saw in Chapter 14 , the ransom is a supreme expression of Jehovah ’ s love and justice . How should we respond ?

12 To illustrate : Imagine that you live in a town where most of the residents are employed at a large factory . You and your neighbors are well paid for your labors and lead comfortable lives . That is , until the day the factory closes its doors . The reason ? The factory manager turned corrupt , forcing the business into bankruptcy . Suddenly out of work , you and your neighbors are unable to pay the bills . Marriage mates , children , and creditors suffer because of that one man ’ s corruption . Is there a way out ? Yes ! A wealthy benefactor decides to intervene . He appreciates the value of the company . He also feels for its many employees and their families . So he arranges to pay off the company ’ s debt and reopen the factory . The cancellation of that one debt brings relief to the many employees and their families and to the creditors . Similarly , the cancellation of Adam ’ s debt benefits untold millions .

All of this indicates that rather than depending solely on oral transmission , Jesus ’ early disciples were very much involved in studying , reading , and writing . They were students , teachers , and writers . Above all , they were spiritual men who relied on the holy spirit to guide them . Jesus assured them that “ the spirit of the truth ” would ‘ bring back to their minds all the things he had told them . ’ ( John 14 :17 , 26 ) God ’ s holy spirit helped them both to remember and to put into writing what Jesus did and said , even lengthy quotations , such as the Sermon on the Mount . ( Matthew , chapters 5-7 ) The spirit also guided the Gospel writers in recording what Jesus at times felt and what he said in prayer .—Matthew 4 :2 ; 9 :36 ; John 17 :1-26 .

10 But what about communicating with God ? Can we speak to Jehovah ? It is an awe-inspiring thought . If you were to try to approach the most powerful ruler in your land in order to talk about some personal concern of yours , what would be your chances of success ? In some cases , the very attempt might prove dangerous ! In the days of Esther and Mordecai , a person could be put to death for approaching the Persian monarch without a royal invitation to do so . ( Esther 4 :10 , 11 ) Now imagine coming before the Sovereign Lord of the universe , compared to whom even the most powerful of humans “ are as grasshoppers . ” ( Isaiah 40 :22 ) Should we feel too intimidated to approach him ? By no means !
16 The people then went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians , so that a seah measure of fine flour came to be worth a shekel , and two seah measures of barley came to be worth a shekel , according to the word of Jehovah . 17 The king had appointed the adjutant whom he relied on to be in charge of the gate , but the people trampled him to death at the gate , just as the man of the true God had told the king when he came down to him . 18 It happened just as the man of the true God had said to the king : “ Two seah measures of barley will be worth a shekel , and a seah measure of fine flour will be worth a shekel tomorrow at this time at the gate of Sa·marʹi·a . ” 19 But the adjutant had said to the man of the true God : “ Even if Jehovah should open floodgates in the heavens , could such a thing take place ? ” To this E·liʹsha had said : “ You will see it with your own eyes , but you will not eat from it . ” 20 That is exactly what happened to him , because the people trampled him to death at the gate .

The article “ Gospel of the Kingdom , ” in the July 1 , 1920 , issue of The Watch Tower , was what A . H . Macmillan later called “ the first official expression of the worldwide preaching work as it is now actually being carried out . ” That article urged all anointed Christians to “ give a testimony to the world that the kingdom of heaven is at hand . ” Today , Christ ’ s brothers “ to whom the work is entrusted ” have been joined by millions who zealously preach the word while they await the Messianic golden age .
6 For this reason I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God that is in you through the laying of my hands on you . 7 For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice , but one of power and of love and of soundness of mind . 8 So do not become ashamed either of the witness about our Lord or of me , a prisoner for his sake , but take your part in suffering adversity for the good news by relying on the power of God . 9 He saved us and called us with a holy calling , not because of our works , but because of his own purpose and undeserved kindness . This was given to us in connection with Christ Jesus before times long ago , 10 but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation of our Savior , Christ Jesus , who has abolished death and has shed light on life and incorruption through the good news , 11 for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher .

I do not want to send them away hungry , for they may give out on the road . ” 33 However , the disciples said to him : “ Where in this isolated place are we going to get enough bread to satisfy a crowd of this size ? ” 34 At this Jesus said to them : “ How many loaves do you have ? ” They said : “ Seven , and a few small fish . ” 35 So after instructing the crowd to recline on the ground , 36 he took the seven loaves and the fish , and after offering thanks , he broke them and began giving them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds . 37 And all ate and were satisfied , and they took up seven large baskets full of leftover fragments . 38 Now those eating were 4 ,000 men , as well as women and young children . 39 Finally , after sending the crowds away , he got into the boat and came into the region of Magʹa·dan .

6 Jehovah has a boundless store of knowledge . As the “ King of eternity , ” he alone has been alive forever . ( Revelation 15 :3 ) And during all those untold ages , he has been aware of everything . The Bible says : “ There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight , but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting . ” ( Hebrews 4 :13 ; Proverbs 15 :3 ) As the Creator , Jehovah has full understanding of what he has made , and he has observed all human activity from the start . He examines each human heart , missing nothing . ( 1 Chronicles 28 :9 ) Having created us as free moral agents , he is pleased when he sees that we are making wise choices in life . As the “ Hearer of prayer , ” he listens to countless expressions at once ! ( Psalm 65 :2 ) And needless to say , Jehovah has a perfect memory .

He emptied himself and took a slave ’ s form . ” ( Phil . 2 :5 , 7 ) Each of us would do well to ask , ‘ Can I follow Jesus ’ example even more closely than I am already doing ? ’ —Read 1 Peter 2 :21 .

13 Now David ’ s son Abʹsa·lom had a beautiful sister named Taʹmar , and David ’ s son Amʹnon fell in love with her . 2 Amʹnon was so distressed that he became sick because of his sister Taʹmar , for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible for Amʹnon to do anything to her . 3 Now Amʹnon had a companion named Je·honʹa·dab , the son of Shimʹe·ah , David ’ s brother ; and Je·honʹa·dab was a very clever man . 4 So he said to him : “ Why are you , the king ’ s son , so depressed every morning ? Why not tell me ? ” Amʹnon replied to him : “ I am in love with Taʹmar , the sister of my brother Abʹsa·lom . ” 5 Je·honʹa·dab replied to him : “ Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick . When your father comes to see you , say to him , ‘ Please , let my sister Taʹmar come and serve me some food . If she prepares the food given to the sick before my eyes , I will eat it from her hand . ’ ”
It is of interest to Christians today to consider how Paul dealt with the charges . He stayed calm and respectful . Paul referred to the Law and the Prophets , and he claimed the right to worship ‘ the God of his forefathers . ’ That was a right that other Jews had under Roman law . ( Acts 24 :14 ) In time , Paul was able to defend and proclaim his faith before the next governor , Porcius Festus , as well as before King Herod Agrippa .

So , please , let us make a three-day journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God . ’ 19 But I myself well know that the king of Egypt will not give you permission to go unless a mighty hand compels him . 20 So I will have to stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my extraordinary acts that I will do in it , and after that he will send you out . 21 And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians , and when you go , you will by no means go empty-handed . 22 Each woman must ask her neighbor and the woman lodging in her house for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing , and you will put them on your sons and your daughters ; and you will plunder the Egyptians . ”

8 God ’ s holy spirit is endlessly versatile . Jehovah can use it to carry out any purpose that he has in mind . Aptly , then , in the Bible , God ’ s spirit is figuratively called his “ finger , ” his “ strong hand , ” or his “ outstretched arm . ” ( Luke 11 :20 ; Deuteronomy 5 :15 ; Psalm 8 :3 ) Just as a man might apply his hand to a wide range of tasks requiring varying degrees of strength or finesse , so God can use his spirit to accomplish any purpose—such as creating the infinitesimal atom or parting the Red Sea or enabling first-century Christians to speak in foreign tongues .

When confronted with death , servants of God in the past did not hesitate to express their fears to Jehovah God . For example , on learning that he was going to die , 39-year-old King Hezekiah voiced his despair . ( Isaiah 38 :9-12 , 18-20 ) Similarly , terminally ill people must be allowed to express sadness at seeing their life cut short . Perhaps they feel frustrated because personal goals , such as traveling , having a family , seeing grandchildren grow up , or serving God to a fuller extent , are now beyond their reach . Maybe they are afraid that friends and family members will distance themselves because of fear of not knowing how to react . ( Job 19 :16-18 ) The fear of suffering , of losing control of bodily functions , or of dying alone may also weigh upon their minds .

MY INTEREST in Bible truth had already been aroused earlier . My mother had obtained Bible publications , and I became engrossed in their contents , particularly the illustrations . My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning . However , I was curious and asked questions , so she studied with me when my father was out of the house . As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to Jehovah . I was baptized in Blackpool , England , in 1943 at the age of ten .

9 In addition to being “ the way , ” Jesus said that he is “ the truth and the life . ” This indicates that his role is much more than that of being the means of approach to the Father . Jesus also has roles that are vital to the understanding of Bible truth and the gaining of everlasting life . Truly , concealed in Jesus are spiritual gems of incomparable value , waiting for careful students of the Bible to discover . Let us examine some of the gems that directly affect our future prospects and our relationship with God .

32 As for the rest of the history of Hez·e·kiʹah and his acts of loyal love , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Aʹmoz , in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel . 33 Then Hez·e·kiʹah was laid to rest with his forefathers , and they buried him in the ascent to the burial places of the sons of David ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death . And his son Ma·nasʹseh became king in his place .

Jehovah recognizes that family heads must work hard to provide for their loved ones . “ Prepare your work out of doors , ” says Proverbs 24 :27 , “ and make it ready for yourself in the field . ” Yet , your family ’ s spiritual needs can not be overlooked . Hence , the verse continues : “ Afterward you must also build up your household . ” How can family heads do this ? Proverbs 24 :3 says : “ By discernment [ a household ] will prove firmly established . ”

3 In earlier chapters of this book , we discussed how Jesus perfectly imitated Jehovah ’ s power , justice , and wisdom . How , though , did Jesus reflect his Father ’ s love ? Let us examine three facets of Jesus ’ love—his self-sacrificing spirit , his tender compassion , and his willingness to forgive .

17 Knowing that there is a resurrection and knowing the One who is the source of that provision enables us to be strong in the faith . This fortifies us to be loyal to God even if threatened with death at the hands of violent persecutors . Satan has long used fear of untimely death as a means of holding people in slavery . But Jesus did not have such fear . He proved faithful to Jehovah right down to death . Through his ransom sacrifice , Jesus provided the means for freeing others from such fear .—Hebrews 2 :14 , 15 .
They stood still , holding back the floods ;
17 Third , appreciation for our role in Jehovah ’ s service will grow as we , in imitation of our God , look for the good in others . Instead of seeking the spotlight or always stepping in to take over , we will more often find ourselves modestly seeking the advice of others and yielding to their suggestions . ( Prov . 13 :10 ) We will rejoice with them when they receive privileges . And we will praise Jehovah as we see how he blesses “ the entire association of [ our ] brothers in the world . ” —1 Pet . 5 :9 .

5 And at the time of the evening grain offering , I stood up from my humiliation , with my garment and my sleeveless coat torn apart , and I got down on my knees and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God . 6 And I said : “ O my God , I feel ashamed and embarrassed to raise my face to you , O my God , for our errors have multiplied over our heads and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens . 7 From the days of our forefathers until this day our guilt has been great ; and because of our errors , we , our kings , and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands , to the sword , to captivity , to plunder , and to disgrace , as is the case today . 8 But now for a brief moment , favor has come from Jehovah our God by letting a remnant escape and by giving us a secure position in his holy place , to make our eyes shine , O our God , and to revive us a little in our slavery . 9 For although we are slaves , our God has not abandoned us in our slavery ; but he has extended his loyal love toward us before the kings of Persia , to revive us so as to raise up the house of our God and to restore its ruins and to give us a stone wall in Judah and in Jerusalem .

22 On the days of worldly celebrations , a Christian would be careful that his conduct not give others the impression that he is joining in the celebration . “ Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else , ” wrote Paul , “ do all things for God ’ s glory . ” ( 1 Corinthians 10 :31 ; see the box “ Making Wise Decisions . ” ) On the other hand , if a custom or a celebration clearly retains no false religious significance , is not part of a political or patriotic observance , and violates no Bible principles , then each Christian might make a personal decision as to whether he will share in it . At the same time , he would consider the feelings of others so as not to become a cause for stumbling .

9 Jehovah gave Adam and Eve another command , which included a clear statement of the penalty if violated : “ As for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad , you must not eat from it , for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die . ” ( Gen . 2 :17 ) Was this command in any way unjust , unnecessary , or unreasonable ? Did it rob Adam and Eve of their freedom ? Certainly not . In fact , a number of Bible scholars comment on the logic and good sense of the command . For example , one scholar observes : “ The inference of God ’ s commands in [ Genesis 2 :16 , 17 ] is that only God knows what is good . . . for humanity and only God knows what is not good . . . for them . To enjoy the ‘ good , ’ humankind must trust God and obey him . If they disobey , they will be left to decide for themselves what is good . . . and what is not good . ” That is a burden that humans could not carry successfully on their own .

They had an old car that they sold to me for $ 25 , exactly what I had been paid for my wrecked one . This was the first time I clearly saw that Jehovah provided a necessity for me because I was putting Kingdom interests first . On this visit , the McCartneys introduced me to a lovely theocratic sister , Bethel Crane . Her mother , Ruth , a zealous Witness in Wellington , Kansas , continued pioneering into her 90 ’ s . Bethel and I were married less than a year later , in 1958 , and she joined me as a pioneer in El Dorado .

37 “ This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel : ‘ God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me . ’ 38 This is the one who came to be among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Siʹnai and with our forefathers , and he received living sacred pronouncements to give us . 39 Our forefathers refused to obey him , but they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt , 40 saying to Aaron : ‘ Make gods for us to go ahead of us . For we do not know what has happened to this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt . ’ 41 So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and began to enjoy themselves in the works of their hands . 42 So God turned away from them and handed them over to offer sacred service to the army of heaven , just as it is written in the book of the Prophets : ‘ It was not to me that you made offerings and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness , was it , O house of Israel ? 43 But it was the tent of Moʹloch and the star of the god Reʹphan that you took up , the images that you made to worship them .

4 So Aʹbram went just as Jehovah had told him , and Lot went with him . Aʹbram was 75 years old when he left Haʹran . 5 Aʹbram took his wife Sarʹai and Lot the son of his brother and all the goods that they had accumulated and the people whom they had acquired in Haʹran , and they set out for the land of Caʹnaan . When they reached the land of Caʹnaan , 6 Aʹbram traveled through the land as far as the site of Sheʹchem , near the big trees of Moʹreh . At that time the Caʹnaan·ites were in the land . 7 Jehovah then appeared to Aʹbram and said : “ To your offspring I am going to give this land . ” So he built an altar there to Jehovah , who had appeared to him . 8 Later he moved from there to the mountainous region east of Bethʹel and pitched his tent with Bethʹel on the west and Aʹi on the east . There he built an altar to Jehovah and began to call on the name of Jehovah . 9 Afterward , Aʹbram broke camp and journeyed toward the Negʹeb , moving his camp from one place to another .

Of course , Paul himself did not believe that death meant an eternity of oblivion . He was convinced that the dead could live again , with the prospect of never dying at all . That conviction was founded on an event of immense importance , the truthfulness of which he considered to be unassailable—the resurrection of Christ Jesus . That resurrection , in fact , was the greatest single event that strengthened the faith of the early disciples .

THE world in general pays less and less attention to sacred things . French sociologist Edgar Morin stated : “ All the foundations upon which morals are based—God , nature , homeland , history , reason—have lost their unquestionable nature . . . . People pick and choose their values . ” This reflects “ the spirit of the world , ” or “ the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience . ” ( 1 Corinthians 2 :12 ; Ephesians 2 :2 ) That irreverent spirit is not shared by those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah and who willingly submit to his rightful sovereignty . ( Romans 12 :1 , 2 ) Rather , God ’ s servants realize the vital place that sacredness , or holiness , has in their worship of Jehovah . What things in our life should be sacred ? This article will consider five things that are holy to all of God ’ s servants . The next article will focus on the sacredness of our Christian meetings .

9 Jehovah directed his people to keep separate from the pagan nations surrounding them . ( 1 Kings 11 :1 , 2 ) However , some fanatic religious leaders encouraged the people to hold all non-Jews in contempt . The Mishnah even included this rule : “ Cattle may not be left in the inns of the gentiles since they are suspected of bestiality . ” Such blanket prejudice against all non-Jews was unjust and quite contrary to the spirit of the Mosaic Law . ( Leviticus 19 :34 ) Other man-made rules demeaned women . The oral law said that a wife should walk behind , not beside , her husband . A man was warned against conversing with a woman in public , even his own wife . Like slaves , women were not allowed to offer testimony in court . There was even a formal prayer in which men thanked God that they were not women .

8 The Levites and all Judah did exactly what Je·hoiʹa·da the priest had commanded . So each one took his men who were on duty on the Sabbath , together with those who were off duty on the Sabbath , for Je·hoiʹa·da the priest had not dismissed the divisions from their duty . 9 Je·hoiʹa·da the priest then gave the chiefs of hundreds the spears and the bucklers and the circular shields that had belonged to King David , which were in the house of the true God . 10 He then stationed all the people , each with his weapon in hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , by the altar and by the house , all around the king . 11 Then they brought the king ’ s son out and put on him the crown and the Testimony and made him king , and Je·hoiʹa·da and his sons anointed him . Then they said : “ Long live the king ! ”

6 In time the Amʹmon·ites saw that they had become a stench to David , so Haʹnun and the Amʹmon·ites sent 1 ,000 silver talents to hire chariots and horsemen from Mes·o·po·taʹmi·a , Aʹram-maʹa·cah , and Zoʹbah . 7 Thus they hired 32 ,000 chariots , along with the king of Maʹa·cah and his people . Then they came and camped before Medʹe·ba . The Amʹmon·ites gathered together from their cities and came out for the battle .

17 It is also wise to remember that since we all have faults , we may be offending others . If we discern that we have done so , the Bible ’ s direction is to go to the one whom we have offended and try to reconcile matters . ( Read Matthew 5 :23 , 24 . ) We appreciate it when others do not hold our faults against us , so we should act the same way toward them . Colossians 3 :13 urges us : “ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . Just as Jehovah freely forgave you , you must also do the same . ” Christian love “ does not keep account of the injury , ” observes 1 Corinthians 13 :5 . If we practice forgiving others , Jehovah will forgive us . Yes , when it comes to handling the faults of others , the Christian course is to imitate our merciful Father ’ s dealings with us when we make mistakes .—Read Psalm 103 :12-14 .
In the Bible , we learn Jehovah ’ s thoughts , which help us know right from wrong and help us to train our conscience .

Your best protection against Satan is to have Jehovah as your friend . Jehovah God and his angels are far more powerful than Satan and his demons .

12 Brothers , I beg you , become as I am , because I also used to be as you are . You did me no wrong . 13 But you know that it was because of a physical illness that I had my first opportunity to declare the good news to you . 14 And though my physical condition was a trial for you , you did not treat me with contempt or disgust ; but you received me like an angel of God , like Christ Jesus . 15 Where is that happiness you had ? For I bear you witness that , if it had been possible , you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me . 16 So , then , have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth ? 17 They are zealous to win you over , but not for a good purpose ; they want to alienate you from me , so that you may be eager to follow them . 18 However , it is always fine for someone to seek zealously after you for a good purpose and not just when I am present with you , 19 my little children , for whom I am again experiencing birth pains until Christ is formed in you . 20 I wish I could be present with you just now and speak in a different way , because I am perplexed over you .

3 There was a man of the Pharisees named Nic·o·deʹmus , a ruler of the Jews . 2 This one came to him in the night and said to him : “ Rabbi , we know that you have come from God as a teacher , for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him . ” 3 In response Jesus said to him : “ Most truly I say to you , unless anyone is born again , he can not see the Kingdom of God . ” 4 Nic·o·deʹmus said to him : “ How can a man be born when he is old ? He can not enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born , can he ? ” 5 Jesus answered : “ Most truly I say to you , unless anyone is born from water and spirit , he can not enter into the Kingdom of God . 6 What has been born from the flesh is flesh , and what has been born from the spirit is spirit . 7 Do not be amazed because I told you : You people must be born again . 8 The wind blows where it wants to , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going . So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit . ”

9 To this Jonʹa·than said : “ It is unthinkable to suggest that about you ! If I learn that my father is determined to harm you , would I not tell you ? ” 10 Then David said to Jonʹa·than : “ Who will tell me whether your father gives you a harsh answer ? ” 11 Jonʹa·than said to David : “ Come , let us go out into the field . ” So both of them went out into the field . 12 And Jonʹa·than said to David : “ Let Jehovah the God of Israel be a witness that I will sound out my father about this time tomorrow or by the third day . If he is favorably disposed toward David , will I not then send you word and disclose it to you ? 13 But if my father intends to harm you , may Jehovah do that and more to Jonʹa·than if I do not disclose it to you and send you away in peace . May Jehovah be with you , just as he was with my father . 14 And will you not show me the loyal love of Jehovah while I am alive and even when I die ? 15 Never withdraw your loyal love from my household , even when Jehovah wipes out all the enemies of David from the face of the earth . ” 16 So Jonʹa·than made a covenant with the house of David , saying , “ Jehovah will require it and call David ’ s enemies to account . ” 17 So Jonʹa·than had David swear again by his love for him , for he loved him as he loved himself .
This is what I will do for them , and I will not abandon them . ”

26 So Joʹab left David and sent messengers after Abʹner , and they brought him back from the cistern of Siʹrah ; but David did not know anything about it . 27 When Abʹner returned to Hebʹron , Joʹab took him aside inside the gate to speak with him privately . However , there he stabbed him in the abdomen , and he died ; this was for killing his brother Asʹa·hel . 28 When David heard about it later , he said : “ I and my kingdom are forever innocent before Jehovah of the bloodguilt for Abʹner the son of Ner . 29 May it turn back on the head of Joʹab and on the entire house of his father . May Joʹab ’ s house never be without a man suffering from a discharge or a leper or a man working at the spindle or one falling by the sword or one in need of food ! ” 30 So Joʹab and his brother A·bishʹai killed Abʹner because he had put Asʹa·hel their brother to death in the battle at Gibʹe·on .

Anything that we feel , think , or do that is against Jehovah or his will is sin . Because sin damages our relationship with God , he has given us laws and principles that help us to avoid intentional sin . In the beginning , Jehovah created everything perfect , but when Adam and Eve chose to disobey Jehovah , they sinned and were no longer perfect . They grew old and died , and because we inherited sin from Adam , we too grow old and die .

11 When the Israelites left Egypt in 1513 B .C .E . , they may have numbered more than three million . Spanning three or even four generations , there were children , elderly ones , and no doubt some who were infirm or disabled . To lead such a vast crowd out of Egypt certainly called for an understanding and thoughtful Leader . Jehovah , by means of Moses , proved to be such . As a result , the Israelites felt safe as they left the only home they had ever known .—Ps . 78 :52 , 53 .

9 How might we give in to the danger of letting others choose for us ? Peer pressure could sway us to make a bad decision . ( Prov . 1 :10 , 15 ) Still , no matter how others try to pressure us , it is our responsibility to follow our Bible-trained conscience . In many respects , if we let others make our decisions , we are essentially deciding to “ follow them . ” It is still a choice , but a potentially disastrous one .

16 Because of the importance of faith and love , Christian Bible writers highlighted these qualities together multiple times , often in the same sentence or phrase . Paul urged his brothers to “ put on the breastplate of faith and love . ” ( 1 Thess . 5 :8 ) Peter wrote : “ Though you never saw [ Jesus ] , you love him . Though you do not see him now , yet you exercise faith in him . ” ( 1 Pet . 1 :8 ) James asked his anointed brothers : “ Did not God choose those who are poor from the world ’ s standpoint to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom , which he promised to those who love him ? ” ( Jas . 2 :5 ) John wrote : “ This is [ God ’ s ] commandment : that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another . ” —1 John 3 :23 .

6 When someone sets out to master another language , he has to do more than memorize new words . Learning a new language involves learning a new way of thinking , new thought patterns . Logic and humor may be different in another language . Pronunciation of new sounds will require a different use of the speech organs , such as the tongue . The same is true when we start to learn the pure language of Bible truth . More is required than just learning a few basic Bible teachings . Mastering this new language involves modifying our thinking and transforming our minds .—Read Romans 12 :2 ; Ephesians 4 :23 .

9 In 313 C .E . , this apostate form of Christianity was granted legal recognition by the pagan Roman Emperor Constantine . From that time on , Church and State began working hand in hand . For example , after the Council of Nicaea , Constantine , who was present at the council , ordered Arius , a dissenting priest , into exile because Arius refused to acknowledge Jesus as God . Later , under Emperor Theodosius I ( 379-395 C .E . ) , the Catholic Church , as the contaminated form of Christianity came to be known , became the official religion of the Roman Empire . Historians refer to pagan Rome as having been “ Christianized ” in the fourth century . The truth is that by that time an apostate form of Christianity had joined the pagan religious organizations of the Roman Empire as members of Babylon the Great . Even so , a small number of anointed wheatlike Christians were doing their best to worship God , but their voices were being drowned out . ( Read Matthew 13 :24 , 25 , 37-39 . ) They truly were in Babylonian captivity !

Where can we find evidence that God exists ? We need only look around us . The Bible reasons this way : “ Of course , every house is constructed by someone , but he that constructed all things is God . ” ( Hebrews 3 :4 ) Do you agree with the logic of that statement ? Perhaps when you contemplate the order of the universe , the origin of life , or the design of that most complex of all structures on earth , the human brain , you reason that something higher than humans must exist .

21 After tearing ourselves away from them and putting out to sea , we ran with a straight course and came to Cos , on the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patʹa·ra . 2 When we found a ship that was crossing to Phoe·niʹcia , we went aboard and sailed away . 3 After coming in sight of the island of Cyʹprus , we left it behind on the left side and sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre , where the ship was to unload its cargo . 4 We searched for and found the disciples and remained there for seven days . But through the spirit they repeatedly told Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem . 5 So when our time there was over , we left and started on our way , but they all , together with the women and children , accompanied us until we were outside the city . And kneeling down on the beach , we prayed 6 and said good-bye to one another . Then we went aboard the ship , and they returned to their homes .
Have you ever thought about the personal conflicts recorded in the Bible ? Consider just the first few chapters of Genesis . Cain kills Abel ( Gen . 4 :3-8 ) ; Lamech kills a young man for striking him ( Gen . 4 :23 ) ; the shepherds of Abraham ( Abram ) and Lot quarrel ( Gen . 13 :5-7 ) ; Hagar despises Sarah ( Sarai ) , who becomes upset with Abraham ( Gen . 16 :3-6 ) ; Ishmael is against everyone and everyone ’ s hand is against him . ( Gen . 16 :12 ) Why does the Bible mention such conflicts ? Well , one reason is that it helps imperfect humans learn why they need to keep peace . It also shows us the way we can do this . We benefit from reading Bible accounts about real people struggling with real problems . We learn about the results of their efforts and may thus be able to apply such points to some situations we encounter in life . Indeed , all of this helps us to consider how we should or should not deal with similar issues . w16 .05 1 :1 , 2

The Armistice of Villa Giusti , which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I , resulted in Italian annexation of neighboring parts of Yugoslavia . During the interwar period , the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of Italianisation in the areas it annexed , which suppressed Slavic language , schools , political parties , and cultural institutions . During World War II , Italian war crimes included extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing[75] by deportation of about 25 ,000 people , mainly Jews , Croats , and Slovenians , to the Italian concentration camps , such as Rab , Gonars , Monigo , Renicci di Anghiari and elsewhere . In Italy and Yugoslavia , unlike in Germany , few war crimes were prosecuted .[76][77][78][79] Yugoslav Partisans perpetrated their own crimes during and after the war , including the foibe killings . Meanwhile , about 250 ,000 Italians and anti-communist Slavs fled to Italy in the Istrian exodus .
